Changing to elections by a popular vote sounds like its in the peoples hands instead of juts casting out votes on the slate electors. Aren't we voting for our president. innstead of countting onn the electoral votes to hep out or, go against out favor, it'd be much more easier to just let the people vote.\n",

It'd be less of a hassle to have the florida residents vote,directly, on someone besides the president. Less worring about if theyre going to win or not. Now when you start to think about it the electoral college is just unfair an pretty outdated,if you ask me. Change doesn't sound that bad. All im trying to achive by writting this, is to gain actual control over who we're all voting for.\n",

      "It's also not just what's completely wrong with the electoral college but how does it help in the first place? When you start analizing it, it really doens't help much. How much actual help can the lectora coellge make, in my defense not much. Why? Simple, its just 20-30 more votes and not many states have that much Hawaii has uop to 4 electoral votes, not much. Voters should be alowed to directly vote for who they want to be president and not rely on the lectoral college.    \n"

    "1. 一般语言处理中对全部数据只会取常用的n个词，在此之外的词是不认识的，即先有一本字典\n",
    "2. 用one-hot编码时，每个词都表示为长n的向量，其中只有一个值是1，其余全是0。比如字典的第i（0开始）个单词其编码中1值的下标是i\n",
    "\n",
    "## embedding\n",
    "1. one_hot编码稀疏，所以考虑用稠密向量表示词，比如只用长为m<n的向量表示n个单词，其中单词间关系可以体现在向量间关系中，比如$\\vec{男}+\\vec{国王}=\\vec{皇帝}$\n",
    "2. 可由embedding层实现这个，embedding记录了一个(n,m)的矩阵，每行都是一个单词的稠密向量，作用是one-hot编码的向量按照其1值的下标i访问这个矩阵第i行，取出这行向量作为新输入\n",
    "3. 具体使用看下面代码说明\n",
    "4. embedding可由自行训练出，也可预加载预训练参数。使用预训练参数时，冻结此层\n",

    "2. 对每个词，其都会和当前的hadden_input一起进入网络(cat或add)进行一步（liner、tanh激活）运算，所得的输出作为新的hadden_input与下一个词的向量一起进入网络（cat或add）\n",
    "3. cat（最后一维）的话，需要截断，或者另外卷积一次获得新hadden_input\n",
    "4. pytorch的rnn为x[i]通过一liner，hidden通过一liner，两个结果相加经Tanh激活，结果作为x[i]和新hidden，具体见下面代码"
