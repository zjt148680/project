0158970BC5D2,"Conclusion.Often times throughout middle school, my teachers would give the students each other's assignments to grade themselves. And afterwards, we would see in the grade book that the grade changed because the students weren't grading the assignments the way they should have been. The student grading was meant to engage the classroom, but it turned into a showcase of how students dont really know how to grade the way teachers do. If students are unaware of how a project is supposed to be graded, they can not successfully design a project that tests whether or not they understand the material. ",3,2,101

023CEE52C08C,"Conclusion.In the begining of the artical it talks abou how Venus isthe second closest planet from the sun and how it is one of the two most similar planets to Earth. Since it has similarities to Earths' size and density scientest have sentunmanded spacecrafts to Venus to investigate.

Unfortunatlly no space craft has survived acording to the last two sentances of paragraph two. In the beginning of paragraph three it states how a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide engulfs Venus. The clouds on this planet are also highly currosive with sulfuric acid in them. The planets surface averages about 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric presure is 90 times greater than on Earth. This concludes that Venus has the hotest surface tempreature of any planet in our solar system. Venus also has obsticals like erupting valcanos, earthquakes, and frequent lightning stikes on the planets surface. ",3,1,150

04147BBED91A,"Conclusion.Students may also use this feature in art classes to really capture what the artist was depicting in the work. For instance, this new software was able to create percentages of Mona Lisa's emotions. The latest innovation in computer software may be very useful for art classes, knowing how a person may be feeling in a painting may help students to depict the artists work, a bit better. As humans, we can tell how someone may be feeling by the look on their face, or the look in their eyes. Most of us would have trouble trying to describe what facial expressions convey being happy, besides a smile. The computer can make exact percentages on each emotion you may be feeling. ",3,2,122

0557D6B9B3E5,"Conclusion.Another reason that the author wrote in the text was in paragraph 2 it states, ""Ofter reffered to as Earth's 'Twin,' Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. ",3,1,43
0557D6B9B3E5,Conclusion.This shows me that when we are able to get over to this planet we will be able to see 'what is over on that side of the river'.Meaning that we will be able to see what the closest looking planet to earth is really about ,0,0,48
0557D6B9B3E5,Concluding Statement.In conclusion the author did an amazing job by giving us (the reader) multiple reasons on why we on earth should go and venture out in our solar system and figure out what Venus is truly all about. And maybe we'll be able to create this planet into a new habitat. The only way we shall know is if we are able to venture out and do such. ,1,0,70

05C9186E77DF,"Conclusion.For example, a friend could probably tell how you feel by looking at your face. But some people might have trouble describing what each facial expression means. Dr. Hung had oserved had aritists like leonardo who had studied human anatomy that had helped them to paint human emotions. Similarly, Professor Hungs Facial Action Coding System is able to be electorically stored with some information about human anatomty and emotions. ",3,0,70
05C9186E77DF,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion, I personally think that with the help of this technology teachers will be able to read into their students emotions better. Also, teachers would be able to tell if students are lying to them. The value of this technolgy would be able to help them read the facial expressions of many people with diasbilites who have trouble conveying emotions. I beleive that is this type of technology were to be used in a classroom that it would be a great help to many teachers. ",1,0,88

07D3CBDEFCEF,"Concluding Statement.The age of computers is inescapable, but it doesn't have to be. Instead of computer analyzed emotional connection, people should put their phones down and ask each other how they are. Not every person wants their emotions analyzed, especially in schools. Students bonds with teachers are simply student to teacher; a child must trust an adult before they talk about their feelings. Computer facial technology might be helpful, but not in schools. This technology falls flat in the category of connection. Don't take the easy way out, instead of analyzing emotions with a computer, ask someone how they are. If a student looks upset, sit down and talk with them. Show someone they are valuable and deserve one on one human interaction ",1,2,124
07ECEB4E4BE1,"Conclusion.one of them being the similarities which they can see from far distance the planet has to earth. the author says Venus is often referred to as the earths twin due to the size, mountain like, and believed to have many oceans and waterways making venus very simlar to the earth. with venus being the closest planet as well to the earth having a closer distance to venus from earth. 
",3,0,71
07ECEB4E4BE1,Conclusion.Though Venus is concidered the twin to earth it has many diffrent features making it dangerous for scientist to explore the planet. One of these extreme dangers is the diffrence in climate as said in the article Venus reaches upwards of 800 degrees Fahrenheit easily melting most metals making it hard to recieve samples from the planet. ,3,0,58
07ECEB4E4BE1,"Concluding Statement.In conclution Venus has many similarities to earth, but due to the extreme conditions of Venus it makes it hard for scientist to explore and find out more about the planet, even though it is the closest to the planet earth. These dagers and risk are worthwhile due to the simlarities the earth shares with venus, the new test of equtmeant in which can withstand these climates, and the life in which they believe use to be on Venus all make exporing Venus, even with dangers worth the time.

0821EB1AEDED,Conclusion.These projects that get assign should be more student-designed ,5,0,10
0821EB1AEDED,"Conclusion.Teachers often put a strict instructional guide or manual on what to do and what not to do, during the assignment and limits what students can do and blocks any originality. However, having a student-designed project will unleash a wave of ideas and flow of creativity between each student that would not normally be received from a common project. The whole outcome of the entire project will be changed drastically because of the freedom students will have on their own projects and in which, in the end, will satisfy them. During research projects, teachers also frequently limit the student on what they can look up and use. If the project was student-designed, students can freely look up and use what interest them and learn about something that will make them more engaged into the project. They can not be held by idea blocking rules that will make the project disengaging, they can have creativity run free throughout the entire assignment and it will show. Overall, a student-designed project will make a more standout project due to the original ideas students will leave throughout the project. ",3,2,186

082E19093947,Concluding Statement.Student based projects would be more likely done then teacher based projects. Students would do them off of things they are interested in and subjects that catch their attention. They will do it around there time frame and in any style they want. doing it student based will have students educate them selves about things they enjoy and love to do on daily bases and teachers will have something turned in to them by the end of summer. ,1,0,80
0839B4ACC2AF,"Conclusion.Summer projects are given to students so they can continue to learn and not fall behind in the coming school year. But would it help if the summer projects are created by teachers? Well yes, teachers have been teaching and making projects for a long time and they would know what they are doing. As a high school student I could prefer that my teacher makes the projects verse some student who not much of an expert on the topic.  ",4,2,81

0839B4ACC2AF,"Conclusion.Many of the projects that I have done were mostly teacher-designed and they were easy to understand and finish without too many hurdles. If there were to be any confusion it would be much easier to contact the teacher about a question than a student. When there are less mistakes in the project it would be more time effective and one would be able to finish the project faster.

085BDFC05337,"Conclusion.Your frontalis pars lateralis muscle above your eyes raises your eyebrows when you're surpised your orbicularis oris around your mouth tightens your lip to show anger. The facial expressions for each emotion are universal. They would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy worried etc.

Computers know when your happy or sad if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow but if you frown the next ad will be different. Most human communication is nonverbal inculding emotional communication so computers need to know that to. You can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. A computer animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery.

According to the facial feedback theory of Emotion moving your facial emotions, but also may even help produce them. Putting on a happy face actually works a renowned drama coach had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage.

086603D5B319,"Concluding Statement.if the principal forced students to do extracurricular activities, it would make students more stressed out then they should be. If students don't like the activity they have to do, why do they have to take that activity? The poor students wouldn't have time to breath, and go home. Students relaxing time would be school time, so which one do you choose? Forcing students to live under school, or allow students to have their own life after school, with no consequences.  ",1,0,83

0AD7535C58C0,"Conclusion.Texting while driving can limit your response to someone coming out of nowhere, whether if it's a child, an adult, or a group of teens. When having less time to respond to something in the road while texting and driving it may lead to many accidents and deaths. In addition, the usage of your phone while driving can cause a dangerous environment to the people around you on the road. Anyone can walk into the road at any time of the day and staying off your phone prevents anyone including yourself from getting hurt. In the same way, texting while driving causes many dangers risking not only young teens lives, but also adults lives in future accidents. Texting while driving ""causes own deaths and others, and need to pay attention to what's going on"".

0BDD43321AFD,"Conclusion.Remember in elementary school you used to get summer reading logs and checks on books you were 'required' to read during your break? Some students never had a problem with these types of assignments because they loved to read any chance they could get. Unfortunately, there were also the kids who would dread reading and give up after ten minutes or pretend they did the entire assignment. Though at this age, it really didn't matter whether or not you did the reading logs, it was just a little nudge your school would give you to do summer learning. However, when students reach higher levels of school, especially around high school, the requirement of summer projects is actually a requirement. Lots of students complain that it is unfair to do assignments over the one, long break they receive, but depending on the class subject it is for, sometimes these projects are essential. ",4,2,152
0BDD43321AFD,"Conclusion.During summer a lot of trips and vacations are taken whether with family or friends, near or far. Nevertheless, each one requires people to leave their homes and travel with the minimal amount necessary to save space. In my experience, I once was gone for almost the entire summer. One week I was in Pennsylvania with my relatives and the next I was swimming in the crystal clear waters of the Bahamas. Now imagine if these vacations, no matter how long the duration, were to be taken away from students because of a teacher-designed, summer project. If one was to receive a project of this type, there is no way of telling how much time or the location required to get it done. For example, if teachers were to design a summer research paper on the history of where you live, it might be necessary to go to the public library to view history records. No one can do that or go there if they're skiing all the way in Colorado. ",3,2,172
0BF9F64D6FD1,"Conclusion.When given a task you do not enjoy, most people do either of two things. The first thing they do is rush the task to get it over with, and the second thing they do is push it off as much as they can. Similarly, when a student is given an assignment that is not of interest to them, the quality of work is very low. In reference to the summer, this general idea is heightened; a majority of students tend to push off assignments to the very latest, creating lackluster work and also not learning much from the assignment. Personally, I have experienced this repeatedly. When I was given a summer assignment for my English class this year, I was eager to read the book. While, the book was interesting the assignment was extremely long. The intended goal of the assignment was to expand the knowledge and analysis of the book, but after completing the assignment, I felt like that once held excitement and knowledge was gone. If I had the ability to design my own assignment relating to the book, I most likely would have enjoyed completing the assignment, allowing for an expansion of knowledge. This does not only apply to my experiences with summer assignments, but also applies to my overall experience as a student. When given the liberty to decide my own work, I am not only excited to work, but I am also more dedicated. When my education is in my hands, I produce some of my best work. Currently as a junior enlisted in a self led research class, I have learned so much about myself and the overall topic I am researching. Although at first the task at hand was daunting, I learned how to organize myself effectively and complete a thorough research project that I am happy with. By having the research project on my own, I am constantly thinking about it and I spend more time to work. Giving students the ability to decide their course of work is one of the most beneficial decisions a teacher can make for the future of a student. ",3,2,355
0BF9F64D6FD1,"Conclusion.Some of the most successful people are regarded for their fame and success due to self exploration. In Benjamin Franklin's famous autobiography, he shares his experiences through self exploration. Growing up in a poor household, Franklin's father could not afford to send him to a traditional college education, but through Franklin's own personal endeavors and exploration, he became one of America's founding fathers, discovered lightning, and paved a legacy that is still remembered today. Simple self exploration can start with these summer projects. When a student is given their own freedom, remarkable results can follow. The purpose of a curriculum is to mend our future minds into strong, independent thinkers, so by implementing simple strides of self exploration, schools and teachers are able to mold the minds of successful students. In my own experiences, self exploration has made a remarkable impact. When I was 15 I started my first company, learning everything on my own with the help of a few mentors along the way. Not only did I grow as a person, but my knowledge for business also grew tremendously. Through the use of online resources, videos, and contacts, I was able to produce something I am truly proud of. The work I put in, was time I wanted to because I was truly passionate about what I was doing. That passion is what we need to strive for. From simple opportunities for self exploration during the summer to long term projects, as a society we need to move towards encouraging self education and self exploration. ",3,2,258

0E5BCFB10650,"Conclusion.Students would learn the responsibility of completing a project without a teacher telling them the process they should follow. The students would have to research and create a project based on something that they are passionate about. For example, every student has their own interest such as baking, rocketry, and architecture. With student-designed summer projects, each student can complete their own individualized project based on their own interests. As to where a teacher-designed project the student has to go with what the teacher assigns. If the teacher is interested in types of frogs, students would have to complete a project based on the interest of the teacher. Student-designed summer projects would give students the opportunity to take control of their education.

Student-designed projects would cause for more creative projects compared to teacher-designed projects, and it would give students the opportunity to take charge of their education. Having summer projects to insure students continuous learning is a terrific way to enhance a students education. But done incorrectly, it can cause a student to dread school more. A well executed summer project would be student-designed, where the student gets to decide on their own project based on an interest of their liking.

In the projects,they design they could included questions that appeal to visual learners as well as topics that appeal to mental learners. In math and science,they can included different ways of getting to the solution to see which way the student do the best on. This allows the teacher to create assignments that cater to the students. Since every batch of students is different this allows the teacher to change their curriculum to fit the students they have this year so that they can leave successful and ready for what ever next. Not all years are going to be the same, Ms. Generic_Name might have a bunch of auditory learners one year but the next she has a bunch of tactile learners and if she designs her projects to look for that.

Some choose to attend and others choose to abstain. I partake in them occasionally, but I tend to go home once the final bell rings. That was before my principal decided that all

11950E4412E5,"Conclusion.Summer break is the most anticipated time of year for students and teachers because it is a grace period that allows for relaxation and refreshment,of one's soul. The summer sees,the mental maturation of many students without the hindrance of a classroom,holding them back. The learning experience offered in a classroom setting is limited only to what the teacher and state permits. Students are not fully able to express their learning passions because they are forced to learn what the teacher permits. Whereas, during the summer students are free to conduct their own personal investigations on topics that peak their interest, resulting in a much maturer student by the time fall rolls around. ",4,2,116
11950E4412E5,"Conclusion.In the future, once students start working, supervisors will not give them examples of how to properly execute a project. For example, my mother is a graphic designer who is required to come with new ideas for campaigns, brochures and websites. Her boss isn't giving her instructions on how to complete the tasks, at all. She must be responsible in using her mind to come up with creative new ideas that she thinks would satisfy her boss. However, at her old job all the graphic designers were given an example they had to follow. Which resulted in the closing of her old company because they only produced the same design. Luckily for mom, she was able to find another job fast because she was to create designs without assistance. The skills my mother used to think creatively and on her own, was taught in school. But, with teachers designing projects, students get used to a formula they have to follow and are not taking responsibility for their own thinking. Students creating their own summer projects would force students to take time and think of a project that they think would satisfy their teacher. It would stimulate new thoughts and force them to activate the create side of their brain that has not been used for a while,due to teachers constantly creating a rubric and examples for the student. The summer is a perfect opportunity for a student designed project because they would have time to develop their thoughts. Teachers shouldn't design summer projects because it aides in diminishing a student's ability to creatively solve projects. ",3,2,267

However, if the projects were student-designed, they would be more likely to complete them since they designed them themselves. These projects would make the students use their creativity, which would lead to more of them expressing their interests. They will be much more motivated to do a project that interests them than a project made and given to them by a teacher.

It is said in paragraph 4, that Venus, long ago, may have been earth-like.

It may have been covered in oceans and supported life.

This is defintely interesting to think about.

If it was like that long ago, why couldn't Venus be inhabitable for humans now?

On Venus, we would have enough solar power, and radiation levels wouldn't exceed Earth's.

19C571180C49,"Conclusion.Although teachers try to fill their summer assignments with care, they fail to understand what the students they are getting actually know. Just because the students should have learned everything from the previous year, most of the time other factors would come into play. Some material was overlooked due to time constraints, while some material was discarded in the depths of the students mind as they felt like they would need it. Nothing felt worse than having a lecture by a ne teacher a material we should have learned the year before, but no one at all could remember it. Having the upperclassmen, who were inside similar shoes to the newer students, make the assignment, they would reinforce what the students will have to know walking into the class day one. Upperclassmen would also be able to address through the assignment what material they never learned that the students would need for the beginning of the school year. Even though the teacher should plan for the students to not have learned all the information from previous years, the upperclassmen, through experiencing the class would be better able to give specifics on what future students need to know before school ",3,2,200

First, students can choose a topic that they are interested in for their student project. For example, if a student likes video games, then they would be more motivated to do their project than a summer project with the topic of gardening. The students will be more motivated doing something they like, simply because they enjoy it. No one wants to do a project that no one likes. In addition to that, students may also be more knowledgable in their topic if they are able to design their project. A student could know nothing about gardening and complete a poor project. However, if a student knows everything about video games, then that student can create a very excellent project, because its a topic they like ",3,2,126

The freedom to do anything, the ability to choose a topic, and solving a relatable problem are all associated with student-designed projects. Student projects will allow students to do whatever they want to do and be motivated. Motivation is the key idea for student-designed projects, because motivation is what drives students to succeed.

1EC48C7220A9,"Conclusion.Luke Bomberger was a seagoing cowboy. He crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific twice to help people affected by world war ll. He took care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

Along his trip he got chance to visit many places. He had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. But to him seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special he also said that taking that gondola ride in Venice, Italy also was.

He fed and watered the animals and cleaned the stalls. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled from the lower holds of the ship and thats what Luke did. During the crossings caring for the animals kept Luke busy.

He was a watchman and had to look out on the animals every hour and report back to the captian. One day he was doing his normal rutien, and he had slid down a slippery ladder an his backside and when he slid a small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, kepping from falling overboard in the Atlantic ocean.

If every single student will do an extra activity, then by that logic, schools would just add an hour to the school day, which I know would not go over well with many. Besides, students already have significant amounts of homework from various classes. Adding another obligatory activity to dedicate time to could very well be too much. Making extracurricular activities mandatory is also just disrespectful to many family's schedules. Maybe a student had already been participating in a separate, unrelated activity or organization. It could be that the student has a religious practice after school, or he or she has to take care of a family member. The examples are endless. Nevertheless, schools should not take up student's time outside of school any more than they already do. ",3,2,151

200AA7A37060,"Conclusion.Often times struggling students or children who ""hate"" school may just feel bored and there are many students who don't try in school because they feel like the subjects they study have no purpose or that it will have no value for their future career. These students often do not participate in teacher designed summer projects as many see summer as their time off from the burden of school and teacher projects appear as boring and useless to them. If these students were allowed to design hear projects, however, so that they focused on topics important to them there could very well be an increase in their participation and desire to learn. When people study things they like and enjoy the often perform better this can be seen at schools like the Generic_School MATA programs where every student who attends wants to be there and as a result they are active and engaged each day. It can be inferred that if the logic applied to the MATA programs is applied to summer projects, students studying things they enjoy increases learning motivation, more students would participate and find value in summer projects.

22FD17FB1BEB,"Conclusion.How would you like to do a boring project on your summer break? Doesn't sound fun, does it? Schools believe that during the summer students need to actively learn. They ensure students continue learning by giving them summer projects. The matter at hand is; whether these projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. It is the students project, so why shouldn't it be designed by them? In most cases, teacher-designed projects are very detailed and include many parts, the teachers expect too much from the students. A student-designed project can ensure interest in the project, teacher-designed projects become boring and there's a lack of interest.

231FDA202B25,"Conclusion.The second issue is safety. According to NASA, they have a solution for getting a spaceship to Venus carefully and safely. ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" (paragraph 5). NASA has a soultion for the safety issue that was recently brought to their attention. The people who want to go and explore Venus now believe that this is one of the final steps toward actually getting off of the ground. If NASA trains astronauts well enough, tries to simulate the conditions on Venus, and everything works well; there is noting holding them back. ",3,2,186
2321FAC1E823,Conclusion.because this insures that the students will be engaged with the project ,0,0,13
2321FAC1E823,"Conclusion.Firstly, because they have choice in what they do, the students will be able to pick a subject or manner of presentation that they are excited about. If the teacher were to assign the same project to every student without allowing the students to have any say in what they actually end up doing, there would defiantly be students who are not interested in the project. Secondly, the students will also understand the project better. The students will have designed their own project, so they will know exactly what the outcome is supposed to be like and how to get there. Many projects are hard for students because they are not actually aware of what they are intended to do, so by allowing the students to design their own project, the school ensures that the students will completely comprehend it. Lastly, having the project be designed by students means that the students will be given more opportunity for creativity. Because the students more liberty over their project, they will be able to use more of their own unique ideas in the project. ",3,2,183

25279CF8444F,"Conclusion.When the school year ends most students are just exited to know that they don't have to learn, knowing they can just relax, hang out with friends, or party. On the other hand, isn't this just holding them back in their learning process? Shouldn't they do some type of project that will allow them to exercise the mind and keep them learning? Well it is easier for the students and for the teachers when they come back from break and the students haven't completely forgotten everything that was taught to them the previous year, so some schools decided to have students do a project over the summer break that can help these students grow as intellectuals . Having said that, who should decide what project to do during the break, the teacher or the student? ",4,2,135
25279CF8444F,"Conclusion.if they have the option of choosing what to do they will always chose something that isn't going to challenge them in anyway and will chose to do a easy topic that they can get done fast, that they already know, or that they have done before ",0,2,48
25279CF8444F,"Conclusion.Even though students are the ones doing the project, teachers are the ones who understand the subjects that student should be learning. If you let a student pick a subject to work on over the summer, he could chose something very unnecessary that would have no impact in the students growth as an intellectual, he could say he is doing a science project that would ask how many hours he can play a video game before he gets hungry and eats food, or before he has to go to the bathroom. Teachers who got to know and understand their students throughout the year would know what they could be interested in and would work on during the summer. For students to be interested in something they want to understand how it works and find it fun to do. In order for students to not slack off and procrastinate they must find it interesting to them or they wont work on it. That is another thing that teachers must considered when giving out the projects that their students must do over the summer, if teachers assign the same project to everyone, many of them can get such projects done fairly quickly and not challenge them at all, having it done so soon they didn't learn anything for the project, or having all of them do the same project would just have them copy each other. ",3,2,235
25279CF8444F,"Conclusion.The teachers give out this project for the whole purpose that given project helps students move forward, they assigned the project to the individual students knowing what would help them grow without having the summer break erasing everything they learned the previous year.  ",5,2,44

25C32F08C197,"Conclusion.Leonardo Da Vinci was one of the greatest reniassance painters of the time. His study of the human anatomy allowed him to create pictures that captured the humna state. On of his most well known paintings is the ""Mona Lisa"". The Mona Lisa is a women that has sort of complacent facial features. She doesn't really look happy or sad. This was the popular thought up until a new technology was created. This technology is called the Facial Action Coding System. This technology is able to deduce what emotion a person is feeling. It is able to do this whothout the person even showing an obvious emotion. This technology can also be implenmented in many spheres of life, including in the classroom. ",4,2,123

26E218908B4C,"Concluding Statement.summer is a vital time for students to take a break from the hardships of the previous school year. Yet, some teachers want to assure students continue their learning over the break. If a school believes summer work should be assigned, projects should be student-designed.

27E6536433B9,"Conclusion.Homework is a required part of school and some schools give more homework than others. In schools that offer AP level classes students have about 4-5 hours of homework each day, giving them no time to do extracurricular activities. Kids are stressed with this work, and putting other activities on top of it is just creating more stress. Parents don't have time too because the average workday takes up most of their time, and driving kids back and forth from each activity can really mess up a parent's schedule. An average workday for parents is about 8 or 9 hours and work is hard and demanding for most parents. This is why the principal should not force kids to do extracurricular activities because some just simply don't have the time. ",3,2,131
27E6536433B9,"Concluding Statement.This is why I believe kids should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities because while they are beneficial they are hard for some. Extracurricular activities cause issues for parents and kids with no time, and in some cases they force kids with disabilities to do things they cannot do. For example, some parents have work from 8 am until 7 pm and this would not allow any time for drop off and pick up. Also kids have a lot of homework, opening up little time for kids to do extracurricular activities. Lastly some kids with disabilities and mental disabilities just don't have the capacity to participate in extracurricular activities. Many say that extracurricular activities should be required, but I feel forcing all kids to do them is wrong ",1,2,132
28314B1AC842,Conclusion.Throughout our school career's projects are often assigned to extend learning during the summer break. Summer projects are more often created by teachers. These projects are rather extensive due to the months that are given to complete it. Those who may oppose state that it is the teachers job to create these summer assignments and they are able to bring more structure to the project ,4,0,66
28314B1AC842,Conclusion.The process of coming up with rubrics and topics in which the assignment could be upon can be difficult. Team collaboration is vital for creating an assignment along side teachers and other students. Having the ability to voice an idea or criticism can be useful not only within school but also in an work environment. Not only having to create but also complete their assignment helps develop a sense of work ethic that is helpful in any situation. Students often rush to complete assignments very last minute and having formulated the assignment they would have a better understanding of how to space out their time to complete the summer project correctly. Along with school assignments this skill can be applied to any work place. ,3,2,125

They also reported that ""nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. With those outrageously high statistics, I strongly agree with the idea of doing away with cellphones while driving. Also, 94 percent of drivers support a ban on texting while driving and 74 percent support a ban on hand held cell phone use. Having that high of a support percentage shows that are many other people who feel the same as I do. It is a very dangerous problem that is going on in todays day. With myself being a high school student and driver, I can first hand tell you this is a major proem with teens. I see many of my friends and also other students of my school using their cellphones while there driving and putting themselves in dangerous situations. ",3,2,163

Making extracurricular activities mandatory will be beneficial to students as it will keep them occupied, allow them to meet people who share their interests, and lead to new hobbies being discovered. When students participate in extracurricular activities, it reduces risky actions they may perform out of boredom.

The reason why it looks like it has a face is because the picture was taken at the moment on when the landform had a shadow at the certain places of the landform to make it look like it has eyes,nose, and a mouth. If you look at the picture from 1976 you can see that it shows more of the face and that it does look like a face.

2E0AF5C8526F,"Conclusion.The process begins when the computer constructs a three-dimensional computer model of the face. All forty-four major muscles in the model must move like a human muscle. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit."" The facial expressions we use for each emotion is universal. The software can identify mixed emotions.

The software is the latest innovation from Professor Thomas Huang. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. He then relies on his pyschologist Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of Facial Action Coding System. He has classified six basic emotions like happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", it tells us how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. ""Why would they want this? ",3,1,144

2E7245D9A04D,Conclusion.An example of why they should be allowed is because the computer just doesnt scan just a few it scans all 44 muscles in your face.

If students are interested in what they are studying or researching, then there is a increased chance of students truly enjoying the project. As mentioned about, a student-designed project will allow for a quality project. The more say students have regarding their schoolwork, the better the outcome of that work. Personally, when given the chance to chose the topic or project guideline, there is a much better result than when given a strict outline. Typically, summer projects appear to be a burden for some students, however, students will not see a project about their passions as a concern. ",3,2,129

318C3D719F7C,"Conclusion.To maintain a healthy, active mind, many students are assigned an educational, summer-long project.

These assignments vary from science experiments to maintaining a reading log; anything that would keep kids busy on their summer-long vacation.

However, there is the question of if these summer assignments should be created by teachers or by the students themselves. ",4,2,56
318C3D719F7C,"Conclusion.Compare the idea of assigning a summer project to the scenario of a student choosing their classes; they are much more likely be perform well in a subject of their interest than in a random class enforced upon them.

Relating this back to summer projects, students tend to better commit to a project that aligns with their interests.

Also, Students are more motivated when they have control over their decisions.

When people take a personal initiative towards what they do, they carry more pride and are more successful in their work.

Personalization of summer projects produce more meaningful experiences that serve as a solid foundation for education. ",3,2,108
318C3D719F7C,"Conclusion.As students are away from school for a long three months, there is no other person better than the students themselves to manage a personal project.

Teacher are not aware of the responsibilities or vacation plans of their students, so the expectations they would set might not be attainable for some students.

For example, a student would not be able to keep up with an at-home project if they were away for the majority of their summer.

Rather if they were to choose their own project, they could more easily manage how to carry out the project in consideration of their personal circumstance.

In general, students would be better at following their own judgment when creating and completing their own project.

Without any teachers to answer their questions over the summer, it is better for the students to be their own bosses.

3254ADC7B428,"Conclusion.This could happen because they would find other kids in they're group who enjoy the same things. Having friends makes school a lot easier and more fun. An extra bonus to having friends is that it is less likely for you to get bullied because you will have people to back you up. Even outside of school having friends is good.

You could even make new friends with your newly discovered skills. Some activities can help you later in life, like if you need to knit a rope because you got lost in a forest, or you need to know how to jump start a car because it broke down on the side of the road, well no problem you already know how to do it because of the activity.

325FE13C0550,"Conclusion.Dr. Paul Echman the creater of FACS has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. using video imagery the computer can track these facial movements, the software can even recongnise mixed emotions. Inorder to identify all movements of one or more muscles is called an action unit. Using video imagery and recognising the facial movements the software can identify mixed emotions each expression is compared against a nuetral face. Every human can make the same face everyday, but you can probably tell when your friend is sad or happy just by looking at their face. While for somepeople its hard to tell when their friends feel happy, sad, confused etc. Dr. Huang got a picture of the Mona Lisa and made people look at it to tell if a computer can recognize your feelings. They also showed people a web ad that appears on a computer screen, If the person frowned the ad would change and when you smile a similar ad would appear. Dr. Huang predicts that a classroom computer will recognize when a staudent is becoming bored or confused.      ",3,1,186

School is the perfect place to learn new things from teachers that have extensive experience in their specific area of expertise. It is the teacher's and administration's job to help provide a well-rounded education for their students and part of that is assigning work that the students do not want to do. Summer projects are important so the students continue to use their brain and learn how to retain information. ",4,2,93

3D7B1F039322,"Conclusion.Charts, flip charts, and simulations are all used by most teachers to show information that is important. In the summer, students aren't going to want to do homework regardless but if the project is set up with clear and concise directions, it makes the work seem less daunting otherwise. For example, if a student had planned a project, the project would only make sense to them because they are responsible for planning it out and the steps needed. When that transfers onto paper, other students won't know what is happening in the brain of the student who created it and will be confused. ",3,2,104

3E6D1917A314,"Conclusion.The author's article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" has a very good look into why we need to explore and learn more about Venus. The athor even gives ideas/ways for NASA to be able to explore Venus. Examples like ""...NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" This is one of the few ideas that the author gives out.

The whole artical is about how Venus is so like Earth or ""Earth's ""twin.""' This is a good artical to look for if looking up ideas for a essay because it gives facts like ""...Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size.""

3E866ECC376A,"Conclusion.A student would show creativity by choosing the colors they like or making it into something that shows significance to them. This would give the project more depth and meaning rather than a simple teacher-designed assignment. Creativity is important in a student's life because it helps speak what is on their mind and generate from there. Completing a regular teacher-designed project would restrict the idea of building from your life and experience.

3F142A739C54,"Conclusion.It gives them an opportunity to pick something they really love learning about and it helps the teacher get to know them better.

They're most likely to put a lot more effort into the project. For example, you were just assigned a project and the topic on it was something you absolutely hated you're not going to want to do the project or put much effort in it and you're going to get bored with it. ",3,0,77
3F142A739C54,"Conclusion.Kids are more likely to get into trouble whether it's because of boredom or they just like it them designing the project will give them something positive to do it'll keep them out of trouble and they'll have fun doing it. For example, one of the students i know likes to ride bikes everywhere even when he isn't allowed to and that gets him in a lot of trouble so one day i took him to the library and we read books and built action figures and he didn't get into any more trouble after that so sometimes all students need is something positive in their life and this project is just the thing they need.

3F142A739C54,"Conclusion.Them designing their own project is an amazing idea because it gives them the chance to be responsible and make desisons on their own. They would have to use their brain to create and complete the project all by themselves. Just because school is out doesn't mean the students stop learning the summer is all about growing and maturing and them creating their own project is a great way to start.

One of my resources states, ""Not only are 27 percent of all automobile accidents believed to result from talking or texting while driving, but smartphone use has also been implicated in several recent rail disasters as well."" The use of cell phones while driving a vehicle is just as dangerous as drunk driving, maybe even worse because studies shown that, ""texting and driving slows the reaction time more than being drunk"".

How would you like to be forced to commit to something you didn't want to do to start with? I'm pretty sure no one would want that. Though extracurricular activities are great for students to do, some are just reserved and are shy when having to do things in front of people. For students with anxiety, that is extremely embarrassing. Plus, if you force someone to do something they don't want to do, they'll just do it with half-effort and that makes everything one step harder for the people who actually wanted to do that activity. I can almost guarantee that this will happen if schools force students to do this, and it'll just make the activities less fun for the ones who actually want to do it. ",3,2,154

The person who is making the software is Thomas Huang,of the Beckman institute for advanced science at the university of illinois""(paragraph 1) .Huang is doing this by trying to recongnize other people facial expression. This computer software is a 3-D printer which can make a mode of the face.""The process begin when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 4 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles""(paragraph3).A 3-D printer is way better then a normal printer.

Dr. huang who relies on the work of psychologist,such as Dr. Pual Eckman,creator of FACS (paragraph 3).The computer will calculate this everyday ""In fact, we human perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday amd for instance,you can probably tell how a friend feeling simply by the look on her face""(Paragraph5).This can calulate every single movement that you make. So here what the people who is making the software want you to do. This a partner they will like for you to take a mirror a genunie smile and forced one.

Also, by having students do extracurricular activities it will seem as if the school gives off lots of well rounded students who have many skills. This will seem very impressive. Lastly, the school's students will most likely have a higher grade point average (GPA) and better scores in general compared to schools who don't require extracurricular activities.

A lesson plan is what teachers utilize to understand what curriculum they will teach and how they will teach it. As a result, the teacher can use the curriculum as their foundation of the project. For example, the International Baccalaureate, IB, program requires students to complete a Summer Reading Project. As an IB student, I had to complete it this past summer. We had a list of books to choose from, and we had to write an essay about the message of the book and make a poster about what we learned from the book. What I didn't realize, was that the book had a connection to what we were going to learn in class. The project helped the students make a connection to the class and learn faster and more efficiently. This results would not be possible, if a student designed the project so this is why summer project should be designed by a teacher. ",3,2,174

That is why a student-design project can end up being more beneficial than supposed to having a teacher assign the students a project where they aren't going to have fun and in the end will probably forget what the project was about. Students learn better when they do something that interests them and benefit more from that then to do a project about the presidents.

52579F4BBE4E,"Conclusion.Most schools require students to complete a variety of projects during their summer break like reading books or completing a math packet. These projects help students continue their learning away from school, except the only difference is that they have all of summer to do it compared to having a due date within a week. Some projects prepare students for the upcoming school year while others act like reminders so that students won't forget what they learned in the past year. Though some believe that summer projects should be student-designed, others will argue that summer projects should be teacher-designed in order to get the best learning experience while away from school. ",4,2,112
52579F4BBE4E,Conclusion.Summer projects should be designed by teachers ,5,0,8
52579F4BBE4E,Conclusion.it will help students prepare for the upcoming school year. ,0,2,11
52579F4BBE4E,"Conclusion.Some students may panic because they won't understand the new material or that they will fall behind in the class because they don't remember how solve a simple question, but if teachers design a project based on their class, it gives students an idea of what to expect. For example, a student will be taking Algebra 2 in the upcoming school year, but doesn't know anything about the class. A simple teacher-designed project that could help a student is a packet with math problems from every unit with examples that explains how to do it, so when students go back to school, they aren't completely blindsided by the new concept. Most schools, mainly high school and middle school, have reading assignments that students must complete before the school year. Reading projects could range from reading a certain book and writing an essay about it to completing a reading bingo where students have to complete a series of reading tasks of their choosing. Yes, the word project seem bland and a complete waste of time while students are on their break, but it doesn't have to be boring as long as it serves the purpose of helping students learn. ",3,2,199
52579F4BBE4E,"Conclusion.I can personally say that teacher-designed summer projects help prepare students for the upcoming school year. Once in middle school, there was a reading project assigned during the summer where students had to pick a book of their choosing that they can connect to and make notes on the side. I decided to choose a book about sports because as an athlete, I could relate to bits of the story. There were a few new things from the book that I learned about, so I wrote little notes on the pages and highlighted the text. After completing the project and returning to school, the teacher then told the class that the purpose of the project was to prepare for annotations, a concept new to students, and to help understand how to compare books that would be read throughout the school year. ",3,2,142
52579F4BBE4E,"Conclusion.For example, if a student takes a language, like Spanish, teachers can design a project where students must write a story in Spanish based on a given prompt. The project could include requirements that were taught from previous classes with some new concepts added in to see if an individual knows new concepts that will be taught in their future class. This will help teachers understand how they can help a student and where they stand in their learning process. ",3,2,81
5310CCBD5B81,"Conclusion.Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine also a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Jet airplanes travel and fly over many storms. NASA is working on more apporaches to study Venus and learn more , the good and the bad. They have enormously powerful computers that works with mechanical ,pressure, heat and other forces.

""vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit so humans would feel nice and tostey but its also not easy conditions, but survivable for humans. ",3,1,108
5353165D1A68,"Conclusion.First off, Venus is one of the brightest points of light, making it simple for stargazers. Often called the Ëvening Star"" but the nickname can be misleadinng since the planet Venus is...well a planet. While also very simple to see from the distant safe advantage of Earth, it proves to be a very challenging place to examine more closer. It makes you wonder what´s even that planet to study about.

Next, Venus´ surface has their temperature average over 800 degrees and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than we experience on our planet. The planet´s conditions Venus has is way more extreme than we thought it would be that we wouldn´t be accustomed to the second we even try to get there. Beyond the high pressure and the heat, Venusian geology and weather present some impediments like volcanoes that can erupt, earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to seek land onto its surface. No wonder why Venus is fascinatiing in some people´s eyes.

Lastly, going over to Venus with a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can only have a limit insight on ground conditions since most of the forms can´t penetrate the dense atmosphere. It´s important to know that researchers cannot take samples of any rock, grass, or anything else in the distance. So if trying to seek to a conduct would have to resolve in getting close and personal despite any risks to do it. ",3,1,242

53E064890ABC,"Conclusion.If a student has had a passion ever since they were a little kid and know that they would like to join a club that builds on that, this policy would help do that. For example, if a student knew they wanted to be part of a club that helps them build on an interest of computer science they would be given the chance to join a club such as the Robotics team. They would be able to use their previous knowledge and joy for their topic, to elevate the team to greater success. If the school was able to bring a high number of dedicated students together to join clubs they would see vast improvements in the success of their activities. These students would be given even more motivation to join the club they love, bringing the best out of them and allow them to join clubs that they know they have interest in. Even though there are some students that know exactly what they want to do and want to dedicate all their time to one club, some students are not like that. Many students would like to explore various clubs and see which one is best for them, creating another reason to enact this policy. ",3,2,209
53E064890ABC,"Conclusion.With every student participating in a club students would spread out amongst the various clubs offered at their school, creating groups of dedicated people who are trying to learn as much as possible to that topic. Currently schools face the problem of kids all gravitating towards the same clubs, such as Science Olympiad and Math Counts. If students don't get into these clubs or feel as though they aren't going to be able to do anything with these highly competitive clubs, they drop out and find themselves having nothing to do outside of school. Many students feel defeated and neglected after they don't do well in these clubs and find it hard to join any other club, for fear that the same tale may happen again. Because of this, hundreds of students intellectual abilities are being wasted. The current issue we face is a lack of students joining clubs after they are shunned away from another club, that is why we need the policy of at least one extracurricular activity per student.

Over break, students tend to discover their true passions and focus on what drives their interest. With projects being assigned, that can be tough and build a wedge between the situation. If summer projects were to be student-designed however, students can make it more personalized and just have fun with it. I believe making the summer projects more personalized to students, can really ease the stress and make it more enjoyable. Overall, it is summer break. As a student myself, a time where this applied to me was in the summer of my freshman year. My teacher had assigned a summer project where we had to determine the area of different shapes in any form. Art is a huge passion of mine and I wanted to engage more of it into my summer. I decided to paint an abstract painting with a variety of shapes; circles, triangles, squares, you name it. It turned out beautiful, I really enjoyed spending my time on something that was educating and delightful. ",3,2,196
5484CC372842,"Conclusion.For most people, finding hobbies that are interesting can be challenging. Knowing myself, I need a sense of direction to know what my interests. It takes a bit of courage to try something new and actually enjoy it. ",3,2,39
54B7666CDA35,"Conclusion.Hello my name is luke and im am in the Seagoing cowboys program. My friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat. I work two part time jobs in a grocery store. It was 1945, World War 2 ended in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins.

This was and opportunity for me to be drafted in the military service.

I couldn't tell my friend no. So I went with him. The cattle-trip were an unbelieveable opportunity for a small -town boy.

Also, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA(the United Relief and Rehabilitation). I had the side benefit of seeing

Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis in Greece.

It took about to weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the united states and a month to get to china.

I was busy caring for the animals during the crossing. My job was to check on the animals every hour. I also found time to have fun on board. We played baseball and volleyball . ",3,1,175

5716C4DAFC9E,"Conclusion.If you aren't required to do something, most of the time you probably won't do it unless it interests you; however if you are required to do something, you will be forced to do it no matter what, but you might surprise yourself, and find interest in that thing after all. Like mentioned previously, my parents made me try out for track when i first started middle school. At first, i wasn't the biggest fan of the idea, but i decided to give it a try; i ended up surprising myself, and Absolutely loved it. I was one of the best sprinters on my team, and found running to be a great way to release my negative energy from the day. Another example of this is my friend Generic_Name; she had no interest in sewing at all, but her mom forced her to try the sewing club at her school. Vivian ended up really enjoying it, and found it very therapeutic, as it was a great way to let out her stresses from the school day. ",3,2,177

This is leaving on eights hours to do homework, chores, ride or walk home, and spend time with family. If you add an extra activity this will take away from time at home. Some of the activities are fished late at night or are held in a place far away so it will take awhile to get home. This makes doing homework hard or even sleeping hard. If a student comes to school sleep it will make the work that they are doing decrease. When this happens the grades will drop slowly but surely. When they see that there grade has dropped this makes them upset and stressed. Creating this viscous cycle ",3,2,137

59A14F276C3E,"Conclusion.For example, every summer, the math department at my high school posts review packets for each class; these packets are made and edited by the teachers each year and include what they have found to be the most crucial topics for students to understand in order to succeed in their classes. The teachers' experience and expertise make the packets beneficial for students, as all of the information they have selected is considered to be vital. This allows students to be fully prepared for the course, because if they understand all of the background information in the packet, then they have all the tools they need to learn and understand new material later in the year. It also ensures that students do not forget any information they learned in the previous year, or, if they did forget it, that they relearn it. In contrast, if students tried to design their own summer packet, they may waste time reviewing unimportant topics and completely ignore more crucial ones, leaving them ill-prepared for the year ahead.

5CD0A11E317E,"Conclusion.Why should the creativity of students be suppressed when they have to complete an assignment or project? Summer break is a time of rest and relaxation for kids who work hard to during the school year; consequently, it's inevitable that students will forgot information they have learned since they are not typically using their brain power while relaxing. To avoid this problem, summer projects are assigned to keep the minds of the students active and to prepare them for the next school year. Obviously, many students struggle with these projects because they are required to follow uninteresting, hard to understand guidelines set by the teachers ",4,2,106

6120EF6FC0BF,"Conclusion.If the projects were designed by students, they might not cover what the teacher intended to cover. In fifth grade, my teacher told us to do a project on whatever we wanted. The only guideline was that we had to present our findings to the class in some way. The variety of the projects was immense. However, this did not bother my teacher because her goal was to get us used to doing research projects before we went to middle school. While it may have seemed as if we, the students, were designing out own project, we were really doing the teacher designed project of practicing research. Another time, in tenth grade chemistry, our teacher told us for the end of year project to do whatever we wanted. She never specified that it had to relate to chemistry, even though it was implied. So when it came time to present our projects, a group of boys went up to the front of the class and started explaining the rules of spikeball. When asked what spikeball had to do with chemistry they said they did not know the project had to be related to chemistry. Confusion like this is easily caused when the teacher does not design the project and leaves it up to the students. That is why if the teacher wants to stick to their curriculum, they should be in charge of designing summer projects, not students. ",3,2,239
6120EF6FC0BF,"Conclusion.However, in high school, it is better to give students more freedom because in their careers they will not always have someone telling them what to do every step of the way and they will have to think for themselves ",2,2,41
6120EF6FC0BF,"Conclusion.But, it is not smart to give students complete freedom as they will have someone who wants something specific out of them when they get a job. For example, when I got my first job at an ice cream store I had to figure things out myself as I went, but I could not just do whatever I wanted. I had a task to complete that was specified by my boss, but he was not there every step of the way and left me to figure some things out on my own. That is what summer projects should emulate for high school students, while projects should be much more structured for younger kids. ",6,2,114
6120EF6FC0BF,"Concluding Statement.Summer projects are great for students and teachers alike, but should be teacher-designed because that way it is easier to follow a specific curriculum, it gets the students used to the teaching style of their new teacher, and it gives students more structure in general. All these reasons are very helpful for students and can not be achieved by student-designed projects. That is why all summer projects should be designed strictly by teachers. ",1,2,75

61607C674FA3,"Conclusion.Furthermore, all different ages of students today are constantly stressed out with the massive workload that is forced upon them each day. One of the many consequences of this is that the students may not actually be learning the material beceause of how focused they are on the responsibilities they have for other classes. A facial recognition system such as FACS could be programmed to detect when a student's facial expression demonstrates stress, and notify the school so they can proactively help the student cope with this stress before the situation worsens. This will help the student relax and focus better. ",3,2,102

6198205BB70E,"Conclusion.Besides in the summer, students spend most of the year under the authority of their teachers. If the project they design is on their own terms, they would have more motivation to actually complete it. Since they are no longer under the school's rule during the summer, students may feel more motivated to do their project instead of being forced to do so during the school year. Students would also have more motivation if their summer projects were student-designed because they would not be expected to meet the expectations of their teacher. If the student designs their summer project to their specific skill set, the student may be more motivated to complete the project because he or she is capable of reaching their own goals. Students would most likely turn in better work because they are not under the stress of their teachers' expectations. Because of this, students would have more motivation if their summer projects were student-designed, ",3,2,159
6198205BB70E,"Conclusion.Without knowing it, teachers block students' yearn of creativity with their own preferences. If the summer project was teacher-designed, the teacher would provide a rubric that exemplifies the specific ways a teacher wants the project to be completed. In doing this, the teacher is not letting the student use their own creativity to complete their project while still follwoing the rubric, but in their own way.. Creativity should never be restricted by one's own personal opinion. Creativity surfaces better with a clear mind along with a clean slate allowing creativity to flow through. If the summer project was student-designed, the entire project itself would be created from one's creativity and their expression through it. For these reasons, summer projects should be student-designed so that students may express creativity freely. ",3,2,130

Creating their own projects would quickly become overwhelming for students, especially if they have no one to turn to for support.

690D9455E629,"Conclusion.It would help them become more independent and self reliant. The students already have to do what the teacher says during the school year, so this would make for a great chance for them to do what they need to on their own time. It would also teach them to be responsible for themselves and for their own work. For example, if the student understands that they are no longer in a classroom setting where the teacher explains everything to them, they will conclude they must rely on themselves to complete the task at hand. Which would lead to more independence rather than depending on the teacher. ",3,2,108
690D9455E629,Concluding Statement.Schools allowing for these summer projects to be created by the students would be greatly beneficial. It gives the students a chance to be as creative as they please and express themselves openly. It also is a good opportunity to teach them the importance of self reliance and how to take responsibility. These are all valuable skills that are going to be needed by the students during a later time in life. It is good to get these skills in early so that the students will understand how to use them later when it is important. ,1,2,98
693C3112ED21,"Conclusion.In Paris, near-records pollution caused by smog, forced city leaders to take action, banning all cars in a 2 day period; and fining all violators of this new ban. This limited congestion in the capital by 60%. Free public transit was also issued for the exception of the ban, even though almost 4000 drivers were fined and some had their cars impound; which certainly helped the number of pollutants on the streets. The smog cleared enough on monday, to where all odd numbered plates were free of the ban on tuesday.

6A97E65BBE95,"Conclusion.Venus, somethimes called the ""Evenig Star"" is the closest planet to Earth. this planets have differents such as, the size between their, the speed that they move around the sun, this speed mean tht sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus.

The big question here is, why humans never visited this planets in more l tha three decades. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, no since no spacecraft survived the landing for more that a few hours. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.

A thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets Venus. On the planet's surface temperatures average oner 800 degrees Fathrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Also notable, Venus has the hottest sufrace temperature of any planet of solar system, wheather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, and powerful earthquakes.

The National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) has one particulary idea for sending humans to study Venus, Venus would aviod the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up andout of their way, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit. No easy conditions, but survivable for humans.

However, Venus can provide only limited insinght on ground conditions because most forms on light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. ",3,1,254

6BF54A9F8383,"Conclusion.Take for example the many young students who have died while driving because they were texting. Looking around while driving, you can see people distracted by their cell phones. These people are not only teenagers but also adults. The shocking truth is that texting while driving increases the chances of crashing by over 23 times normal driving. People have a longer response time when they text. Then the passengers may not be looking at the road because they may be on their phones. On average, an accident happens within two to three seconds when the driver is texting. So if you do get into an accident you could do major damages to another person car or worse you could cause severe health damage to the other person that was in the other vehicle. Using a cell phone while driving caused an estimated 1.5 million car accidents in the U.S. in 2018 according to the National Safety Council. The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that cell phone use while driving kills 3-000 to 6,000 people every year including the other that got was in the accident because of the bad driver.

6CA078E0C93F,"Conclusion.the university of amsterdam, Dr. huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for human and copmputers to communicatre. a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we human use to express we feel. the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the the face, all 44 major musclues in the model must move like human muscles.

the new emotion, recognition softwere track these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa, the different unit, thte softwere can even identify mixed emotion, each expression is compared against a neutral face showing no emotion. the humans perform this same impressive every day. for instance, we can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, that artist such as da vici studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotion.

his new computer softwere stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. perharps Dr. huang emotion algorrithmms are different sort of ""Da Vinc code"" the Mona Lisa demonstration is really internded to bring a smile to thet're face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. a computer that knows when they're happy or sad. if they're smile when a web ad appears on they're screen, a simily ad might follow, but if they're frown, the next ad will be different.

a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. the same technology can make conputer animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, note Dr. huang, so computer need to undersatand that tooooo.

had his actor carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotion on stage. feeling someone else's emotion state, may happen because they're unconsciously imitate another person's facial expression. whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotion ",3,1,347

6D1FB567121E,"Conclusion.When students are forced to complete something they do not enjoy some people just will not do it. If students enjoy the project and look forward to it many more will complete it. For example, I have been assigned many projects during my life. When a teacher gives the students more than one way they can do the project it always has more submissions than if it was only an essay. Specifically, after reading a book, my class had to do a final report. When the teacher gave us options such as a: poster, essay, picture, or model it had many submissions. ",3,2,103

6DFB980B835D,"Conclusion.Having to do schoolwork over the summer is one thing, but making the work student-assigned is whole different ballgame. If the student chose what assignment's they would have to complete over the summer they most likely wouldn't finish it or not even look at it let alone take it out of their book bags. Teacher-assigned assignment's would make the student have to remember what to get done and when to have it done by or there will be consequence's. As a student they may not be fond of it but what it's doing is keeping them learning over the summer and starting them off nicely with solid grades in the upcoming school year. Think about this, during the school year if homework was optional who would do it? Now if a teacher assigned everyone homework and told them to have it done by a certain date for a grade, then see how many student's would complete their homework. It's night and day and the same thing applies in this case. ",3,2,171

Then your teacher mentions summer assignment's that will be designed by him or her. The assignment's will likely be a load and it all has to be completed by a certain date. That's just completely unfair, because you work hard all year just to get time to relax and you can't. It's probably very overwhelming and young students need time to take a break and have fun especially after the long nine month slog they call school. ",6,2,116
6DFB980B835D,"Conclusion.The student would be working on their own time and not on any teachers'. During the summer when people are on vacation and need time off its a great idea to allow student's to get work done, but also have time to do what they desire over break. There's nothing better than working on your own time, having fun, and still getting things accomplished. ",3,0,65

scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks or maybe we should think of them as challenges. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contibute meaningfully to our knowledges of venus.

NASA has the power and money to send people and invest about all these things.

NASA has one particulary compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus.

NASA's posssible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to flot above the roiling Venusian landscape.

Or maybe Venus is just a start because of his nickname and is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky.

Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system,even though Mercury is closer to oour sun.

Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present addicional impediments like erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes,and frequent ligtning strikes to probes seeeking to land on its surface.

NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to flot above the fray.

Venus i the closet planet to the Earth in term of density and size and occasionally the closest in distance to. Should be more easy to study but the value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission.

we should invest if in Venus exist phone or tablet or system that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure,heat,and other forces.

we all have questions like ""if Venus move around just like the Earth does"".

We all want to konw ""if Venus produce live"".

we should keep invest why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus

The temperature that Venus has is too hot for humans is more extreme that anything and the weather present additional impediments like erupting volcans.

Why venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. ",3,1,387

7A0F4648B341,"Concluding Statement.Mandatory participation in extracurricular activities is bad for students because the students may not have time, they might not be interested and they lose the ability to choose for themselves. It is important students that students have the right to choose so they know that there are always options. If students are forced to take extracurricular activites, they will become more disheartened, more weary and tired from balancing their social and academic lives along with sports and other classes, and wake up with less promise that they would have a good day. After all, we do need to nurture our students, as they are the future of the world, as the next generation. ",1,2,115

If the school doesn't have a club or activity that suits them, then they shouldn't have to participate in one. If they do, it's just extra work that'll bore them. Clubs are supposed to be enjoyable, and help students find others that have the same interests as them, but if participating in a club or activity is mandatory, students may feel left out, and not included.

7E2EF53A56BC,"Concluding Statement.In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is supported through Venus' vast similarities to Earth, Venus' proximity to Earth, and the innovation in machines by researchers that could make them work long enough to expand mankind's knowledge on Venus. The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is supported through Venus' vast similarites to Earth, which is why humans have such interest in this particular planet. The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the presented dangers is conveyed through Venus' proximity. The idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite its hostile environment is supported through the innovation in machines that could make the close-up exploration of Venus possible.

80031EC3D9B6,"Conclusion.Many believe that automobiles, especially the very popular ""car"", can be very bad for the enviroment. According to the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", it explains how near-record pollution within Paris caused a partial driving ban. This was to help clean the smog infested air in the dense city. Although many delivery companies complained about lost revenue, congestion within the capitcal lowered by 60 percent. By Monday that week, ""the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuesday"". In another article called ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", this one tells how Bogota, Columbia has also banned cars to promote alternate transportation and reduce smog. The ban is only for one day a year (called The Day Without Cars), but it's helped cause the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, new, smoot sidewalks, less traffic, and new restaurants and shopping areas. Business man, Carlos Plaza claims ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" ",3,2,176
80031EC3D9B6,"Concluding Statement.Cars, both the rose and the thorns in a community and enviroment, can be both benificial and harmful to people, depending on who you are. For most regular pedeastrians and citizens within a city, less cars means less pollution, traffic, and stress. Unless you are a business owner of a car dealership or working for a delivery company, limited car usage means very postive things for social relationships, health, the enviroment, and general living conditions of a busy city. The less harmful emissions of gases from cars could greatly affect the outcome of our clean, energy efficient future.            ",1,2,100

8003F62C4A0C,"Conclusion.The different sides of texting and driving, whether to allow it or not, is an irrational debate.

821EFD80EE4D,"Conclusion.People from the NASA think that aliens built the face on Mars, but actually it is a natural landform. ",5,0,20
821EFD80EE4D,"Conclusion."" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. The ""Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store chechout lines for 25 years! But not everyone was satisfied.

The Face on Mars is located as 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98, a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. Mission controllers prepared to look again. ""It's not easy to target Cydonia,"" says Garvin. ""In fac, it's hard work.

"" Mars Global Surveyor is mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips. ""We just don't pass over the Face very often,"" he noted.

What the picture actually shows in the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common aroud the America West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River PLain of Idaho,"" says Garvin.

""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same heigh as the Face on Mars."" ",3,1,202
82223F37DDCC,"Conclusion.In this passage ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the author made very detailed and valid points about the use of technology detecting what our expressions say about our moods, but, technology reading students facial expressions is over the top. I belive that this new technology would force students to always want to force a smile so that the computer doesn't fully recognize their real from their fake. ",4,0,67

82223F37DDCC,Conclusion.Not every one wants their child to be watched through a computer screen that's looking at their faces to show how they feel. If some one is happy on the inside but frowing on the outside then how would the computer sense that? Sometimes we hide our emotions on the indside and show neutral expressions to everyone else outside of our hearts and mind. Computers can only detect what they see and not what is actually going on. ,3,0,79

84DA3A4E84CC,"Conclusion.Designing their own promotional plans, students from the Technology Student Association were able to pursue college business majors. The Technology Student Association allowed students to be completely in charge of their own work to get a sense of the leadership that is needed in many technology and business fields today. As a result, the ones who were consistent in their work and created their own designs were the most successful at the TSA regional competitions. Student-designed projects allows students to be in control and have the opportunity to manage work responsibly. Even though having a teacher-designed project can help in follow instructions and meeting deadlines, being ones own boss opens doors to many leadership opportunities to excel in the work field, and in ones personal life.

Panera Bread employees that have shown leadership development have moved to higher job positions. In the food industry, like most jobs, employees must start off with a lower position and must enhance their abilities in order to move up to a higher position. For example, in Panera Bread, most new employees start of working as a cashier, dining room attendant, or produce worker; these minor positions prepare the employee with basic skills and prepare them for future duties. Later, when more experience is gained, employees move up to trainer or manager assistant. Similarly, student-designed projects help students learn to be self-sufficient and lead one another to success. As a result, future generations are encouraged to do the same. ",3,2,245

85983B2516C5,"Conclusion.In the third passage of the artice, the author states, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness ... and then associated each with charactersitic movements of the facial muscles,"" meaning that the software associated voluntary or involuntary movements of the face with emotions. The problem with this system is that students can change the look of their face quite easily, and can thus convince the computer to produce desired results, making the system disfunctional. There are quite a few reasons children, especially young ones, would want to make the software not work, including tricking the computer into moving from the original learning program into a more desired one and them simply wanting to see the program fail through their abilities.

899E6252BD6F,"Conclusion.Venus is called the ""Evening Star"" and it's one of the brightest points of lights in the night sky. Venus is the second planet from the sun. It has been often refered to as earth's twin. It's been over three decades since a spacecraft has touched down on Venus. The carbon dioxide level is at 97 percent, and their are clouds of highly corrsive sulfuric acid and the average temerature is 800 degrees in fehrenheit, and the atomospheric pressure is 90 times greater than our planets. This environment would crush a submarine even when its accustomed to diving in the deepest parts of our oceans. Venus also has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in the solar system even though Mercury is closer to the sun. And the weather presents errupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on it surface. Venus once was the most Earth-like planet in our solar sytem that could have supported various forms of life like Earth. NASA has a possible solution to allow humans to study Venus, they will have to where we could hover 30 miles above the landscape so it'd be at sea level and the temerture would be at 170 degrees fehreheit, it won't be easy conditions but they are survivable for humans. They will be limited from what they can see and get. Others are trying for a more simplified approach by making electronics out of silicon carbide, which can last 3 weeks in Venus's conditions. Another one is Mechanical Computers which goes back as far as the 1800s and then played an important role in the 1940's during World War II. They made calculations by using gears and levers and did not require electronics at all. Modern computers are powerful. flexible, and quick but they are more delicate while a system made out of mechanical parts can be made to be more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.

At school, some students who are not shy can be very loud and disruptive during class. If these students join a extracurricular activity, they will not want to socialize as much during class because they will have a extracurricular activity that they could join and talk and share their opinions there.

8EF7C2316736,"Concluding Statement.When I think of school projects, I think of teachers handing them out at the end of a quarter or towards the end of school to be completed over the summer. Projects are a way to either boost or bring down your grade, depending on how you do. Because of that effect on grades, important projects tend to stress students out. When students are given more control over a project it immediately takes stress off the student because they automatically control how their project is made and presented. Teacher designed projects are made to showcase how well teachers teach their students. If more students get a higher grade on a project, the credibility of that teacher goes up. They are viewed as a better teacher overall. While teacher designed projects might have more academic results, having projects be student-designed creates a wider range of creativity, control over how the project is executed, and makes a more postive mindset for students.

Heidrun Walter said that,""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". A media trainer and mother of two,as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

90212225F733,"Conclusion.Student-designed summer projects may allow students to express their creativity, but can ultimately lead them to learn the information incorrectly. Teachers are guides and resources for students to follow when learning information and asking questions. Frederick Douglass, a slave in the 1800s, became self-educated by looking at other students' papers and reading magazines and books. Although he helped himself become more knowledgable about the world through the new information he obtained, he learned some information wrong because he was not guided or corrected by teachers. Student-designed projects can be precarious because teachers cannot correct students if the project is designed inccorectly. If the project were teacher-designed, then the correct information will be present and learned by the students. The summer projects being flawed can also hurt students. By learning the information incorrectly, they are likely to repeat the same mistakes, making it harder to correct them. In the book

Fish in a Tree , a girl with dyslexia struggled with writing because the words kept moving. She got into the habit of writing letters a specific way so that when a teacher noticed and corrected her, it was hard for her to stop the habit of writing letters incorrectly. Student-designed projects can give students the freedom to express their creativity through learning and designing, but this also allows for students to do their project incorrectly because they learned the material wrong, leading them to repeat the same mistakes because the teacher is not aware of how the students are designing their projects. ",3,2,252
90212225F733,"Conclusion.Summer is the period of relaxation and taking a break from school for students. Giving the freedom of designing summer projects to students allows them to make the project easy to complete, preventing them from challenging themselves and learning new information through exploration of the project. Students can manipulate student-designed summer projects by creating a project that is not difficult to do, therefore not pushing or challenging them to learn new information. One example of this was demonstrated by a study of a homeschooled family in the Midwest. The parents gave their children the freedom of designing their own cirriculum for education based on their interests. Instead of centering their cirriculum and challenging themselves with subjects like algebra or chemistry, they studied games and did not necessarily learn anything. By having teacher-designed projects, teachers can challenge the students so they learn the new information about subjects for the coming year, which fulfills the requirements of learning over the break ",3,2,160

For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lested about three weeks...These devices were first envisiond in the 1800's and played an important role in the 1940's during the war...but, these devices made calculations by using gears and levers without electricity...By comparison, systems that use mechanical pats can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces""(paragraph 7).

In the story it said, in August 1945,Luke and Don bolth got there orders to go to New Orleans. Luke and Don arrived they day the war ended. the they went to greece Luke turned 18 before arriving at greece and Luke might be able to get drafted foe the millitary.

Accroding to the text, By the time Luke was drafted he had already made 9 trips the most of any seagoing cowboy. Luke was traviling from the Atlantic Ocean to the eastern caost of the united states. Luke said it took about two weeks to cross the Alantic Ocean and a mounth to get to China. Luke was carring for the animals that were crossing and they had to fed and waterd two or three times a day.

the animals food had to be pulled from the lower holds of the ship so they could eat. Luke was prepard for this because he had to help out on his aunts farm.

Conclusion, On one rany cold night Luke was on watch to watch the animlas and he went to go tell the captian the report and he slipped down the ladder and had cracked ribs.   ",3,1,236

95EE2E824EB6,"Conclusion.For example, there are almost 900 students in my school, This would mean in the 10 after school activities my school provides, there would need to be 90 kids in each one; That's enough to fill 4 classrooms. This brings up another problem, the school can't have 150 kids in one program and 10 in the other, so the school would have to chose the activity for us. Just that fact alone takes all the excitement out of the activity, just for reference, imagine the star quarter back on the football ending up in art instead, possibly destroying his or her whole football career. Most of my school's after school activities need certain spaces for the participants to practice and do their activity. For instance the robotics team only has one room with all of the vices, saws, and tools while the other robotics rooms will have students constantly running between the other rooms getting tools that they dont have in their completely different room. The cheer leading team will have to move to the gym to fit all the people, but so did the pep band, and basketball practice is already in the gym, but they could just go in the auxiliary gym which is smaller than the cafeteria, the problem with that is the wrestling team is already in the auxiliary gym. The school has no room to fit every team and all of the clubs. ",3,2,239
95EE2E824EB6,"Conclusion.A dungeons and Dragons game along with all of the books and die is over 200 dollars, now imagining multiplying that by 7 just to afford the basics for the club. The robotics team pays around 600 dollars for each robot, and more for the competitions, now that program has to buy 15 robots and buy more slots at the competitions. If some how the schools were able to afford these expensive along with all other clubs, teachers, and staff salaries it would come from our local taxes. This would double our local taxes, but if the schools decide not to over tax the citizens of Generic_School than there would be no way the school could provide the gear and equipment for the school's clubs and teams. My school's sports gear is already worn out and our schools are in dire need of new equipment, but there is no way we could spend 7 times as much just to give everyone more cheap and basic equipment. ",3,2,167
95EE2E824EB6,"Concluding Statement.If our schools really made after school activities mandatory, it would be a disaster. One of the biggest issues with this topic is that in its simple form it looks like a great idea, but when you look at the details and what it would cause it shows the big mistake it would be. Giving every student the chance to do an interactive activity they enjoy would be incredible. Sadly, doing that in our current school system would cause all after school activities to stop going to competitions due to the over crowding; The students would not be able to pick their own activity and would be forced to do something they are bad at or just dislike. Making the activities would not only be a punishment to the students of Generic_School but to the teachers, the bus drivers, the custodians, the administrators, the taxpayers, and even our entire county's well being. In this scenario it may at first look like everybody wins, but really when you look at the real facts everybody loses. The entire mentality of school will become even more negative as students are stripped of their choice to do something they enjoy and taken away from time with their family. ",1,2,206

96B312BD472F,"Conclusion.The goal of these assignments is to help the students fortify their knowledge over summer so that it is not lost. These teachers go through years of university studying the subject that they teach, so why should a student who has taken the class for one year have authority over summer assignments. For example, AP BC Calculus is an immense subject with a variety of different units of math. If a student tried to make a summer study guide, they would only have a year of experience under their belt. On the other hand, teachers, who have been teaching/studying this subject for years, have a strong understanding of each unit and how to teach it in a unique way. The credibility of the creator of the assignment must be strong, so the student can have an easier time understanding the subject. Thus, teachers should be assigning summer assignments. ",3,2,149
96B312BD472F,"Conclusion.Many students have a hard time grasping a topic. If students decide to ask a colleague before a teacher, they have the chance of getting incorrect information or no help at all. For example, many students in the AP Computer Science course have to figure out problems of which have many different solution. Students who don't want to give away their specific answer will try to help students figure out a secondary solution. Unfortunately, most students will not be able to figure out a second solution, because they don't have enough experience. Once the student asks the teacher for help, the teacher will be able to help the student find a solution because of their expertise. Therefore, teachers can offer a more valuable source of knowledge that will stick with the student. ",3,2,133

9756E31C449F,"Conclusion.When you might not have classes with a certain friend, it is always a good thing to see them if you have an after school activity with them. The friendship won't fade if you still get to talk to them for even just an hour a day. Sharing what you do after school makes you feel like you are apart of something. I always like sharing my stories about my track meets, practices, and pretty much everything. It's exciting to share stories to your friends instead of saying, ""oh, I don't do anything after school."" You should be happy about seeing the process you made for the school environment. If you end up in the gardening club or even a Junior Honors Society type club, you help make the front of your schools plants look pretty. People will most likely compliment you daily about how it looks and it'll make you very happy. Don't you want people complimenting your work? Lastly, not being in clubs wont make you happy going to school because you have nothing to look forward too. You could've chose between 100 or more clubs to join, but you didn't so you regret it.

The article explains that when the picture was originally captured in 1976, the camera quality was not great. For example the text states, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" So, when given a better camera quality than in 1976, the face on mars no longer looks like a defined face. Although the quality of the camera is a great support, there are many other explanations that put an end to conspiracy theorists. ",3,2,103

In the passage tehy dop have good evidence if you studied anatomy you would be able to understand how all the facial expressions work.

It has terrible weather in comparison to Earth, with acidic carbon dioxide filling 97% of the atmosphere and with heats of 800 degrees Fahrenheit.

With acidic atmospheres ripping through machinery, technologies don't stand a chance on the Venusian surface. With the science that we have, the most we can hope for is a jet-like expirience, flying several miles above surface so that the pressure doesn't crush us instantly. Venus is additionally prone to constant volcanoes, earthquakes, and storms deadly enough to take out machinery.

9C95AF195D21,"Conclusion.Before students enter a class, they may feel anxious about the difficulty of the class. Students may not necessarily know what a specific class is expecting from them. Making summer projects student-designed will give students an idea about the expectations of a particular class. This will reduce the anxiety faced by students because they already have an idea about the kind of work assigned in that class. Students will also get a head start on concepts learned for the next school year. When students enter school, they won't be confused when they start to learn because they already had practice on these concepts on the summer project. This makes academics much easier for students and allows them to have an understand even before the upcoming school year. Furthermore, if students are prepared for concepts learned for the next school year, it will remove the negative connotation that students have with school. Students often don't like school because it is challenging or they do not understand what is being taught. If schools assigned a summer project to students, it will help students think positively about school. This will allow students to enjoy the subject they are learning because they will not be lost trying to grasp the new concepts. ",3,2,209

9D42FF4BDA82,"Conclusion.Venus id the closes planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distamce too. Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other times to Venis. Bacause Venus is somentimes right atound the corner- in space terms-humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world.

A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's armosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures averga over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times grater than what we experience on our own planet.

The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Furhermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames os space travel.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particularle compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus.

More impotantntly, researchers cannot take samples of rock,gas, or anyrhing else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risk. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges.

NASA is working on other aproaches to studying Venus, For example, some simplified electronics the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during world war ll. Modern computers are enormouslt powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicated when it phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. ",3,1,284

Asking a student to complete an assignment over their three month break over the summer is difficult enough; therefore, asking them to design the project themselves and execute it? There is no way they will be prepared to come back to school and preform well in the class. Teachers themselves know the most about the subject they teach, the students take the class to learn said subject from the teacher because they don't know it yet.

9E93D3D95C5F,"Conclusion.The passage ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" is a really intresting passage. In the text states, that ""VAUBAN, Germany-Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars"". This shows, that if they have to go somewhere they go walking. Also the street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbiden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg.

However, In Vauban's streets are completely ""car-free""-except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and few streets on one of the edge of the community. But car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park, and is for $40,000, along with a house. And as a result , 70% of Vauban's families do not onw cars, and 57% sold a car to move there. Because when she had a car she was always tense. Also cars causes lazyness to do stuff, and it doesn't keep you healthty. For example, when you walk you stregh your body and and all the parts of your body are moving. But when you use car you sit down and sometimes that can cause a back problem.

Forthere more, all of our development since World War II has been centerd on the car, and that has to change. In Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with  spread-out homes and private garages, were the drea towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appel. This means, that back then spread-out homes and private garages where the dream towns. In the United States, the Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities are staring to act, caustiously.

Indeed, many experts escept public transporter serving suburbs to play much larger role in a new six year federal transpotation bills to be approved this year. Also in previous bills, 80% have by law gone to highways and only 20% to other transport ",3,1,331

The project has a valid topic, but it is almost irrelevant to the curriculum of the class. A month later, the student realizes that the summer project should have been some sort of a review of the graphing unit last year---which they had forgotten completely.

9FE9D9EB5111,"Conclusion.To begin, cell phone usage when driving can cause a major distraction to the driver who is operating the vehicle. ",0,2,21
9FE9D9EB5111,"Conclusion.All cell phone users can vouch that having a cell phone comes with understanding that there are a plethora of different applications going on within that minuscule device. Loud notifications from social media sites and vibrating text messages from friends and family, even though they may seem important, are all distractions that come with having a device. When someone is distracted, their reaction time when operating the vehicle becomes impaired which poses a threat to everyone on the road, even if they are just a passenger. If cell phone usage is banned from drivers, it would not be the first time or first ""place"" that cell phone usage has been barred from. Cell phone usage has been restricted or banned from vital places such as school and the workforce. This is all for the reason that it can alter that particular person's effectiveness when trying to conduct or produce work. If cell phones are not allowed in these places because they distract people so greatly, why should they be allowed when someone is operating a car that weighs a few tons? ",3,2,182
9FE9D9EB5111,"Conclusion.However, once drivers feel like they have the go ahead to use their cellphone in any capacity, some may still try to go above and beyond to break the rules. Using a phone at any capacity poses a huge risk for all people on the road. ",6,0,47
9FE9D9EB5111,"Conclusion.When adding a person using a phone while operating a vehicle, the risk of killing someone increases. When operating a cellphone while driving, the drivers eyes can be taken off the road from anywhere to a few seconds to a few minutes. Driving is not a perfect situation. People constantly break,stop, speed up, and slow down. Taking eyes off the road for even one second can cause a serious accident on the road. The president of the National Safety Council reported that talking on a cellphone while driving makes one four times more likely to get in a crash. Talking on a phone is such a risk that the National Safety Council has called for a total ban on cell phone usage when driving due to the fact that 100 million people use their phones in a day. Using a cell phone when driving can not only jeopardize the drivers life but also passengers in their car and others on the road. Driving while using a device has the ability to cause a premature death when the drivers are distracted. 
",3,2,182
9FE9D9EB5111,"Concluding Statement.Cell phone usage when operating a vehicle at any capacity is extremely dangerous. This kind of activity poses a threat to not only drivers themselves but passengers and also other users of the road. Cell phone usage when driving can cause drivers to be distracted which in turn if not careful can cause a car crash that leads to serious injuries or death. Furthermore, cell phone usage in a car is not essential and drivers do not need it in order to drive. There is no reasonable explanation as to why cell phones should be used when driving. Laws need to be enacted in order to ban this unacceptable behavior and protect road users. ",1,2,116

taking about Eckman i classified some basic emotions too people now are bored, sleeping, stress, sad, and fear because they want to pass the test and do good this work everyone has something in hi's face.

The facial expressions shows some emotional like happy , anger ect.

every day we have differnt caract or diferent emotional feeling and i don't know how Monna Lisa can be really intended tom bring a smile for us face. i thonk i cant recognize how my best friend feeling is just lokking her eyes cause i know her i and I know when she is happy, sad, bored, confusedand fear, I think people show the feelings but some people can's see because they don't care about it. I think that techonology is a great idea for us or some people who want to know feeling about some people important in their life. I think every emotional has one special moment sometimes are not special but its life and we can't do something abou it. Sonetines we have mixed of emotions like the Monna Lissa. She look happy but at the same time serious. Her smile look like different she can't smile like us. The reson of that is now she is just a painting. Leonardo da Vinci's paint the Monna Lisa but he die that the reason she doens't have the aye browns and thats why she sook serious. That is the reason she look like with different emotional feeling cause she don't have eye browns and she look likr that. we can see the movements in the people face and we can take an idea of how they are or how feeling and emotional are the face show everything. My conclussion is everyone have different emotional but if we want to know their feeling or emotional we need to stay with that person we need to meet the people spend time with him/her we can't say oh I need that techonology to see my wife feeling or my husband felling or a fried I mean is a good techonology but we need to spend time with the person the techonology can't do everything to us. We have the option let the techonology do that for us or do that for people if we really care about his feeling or emotional. For me the better option is the second one meet the people and ask some question to show the special boy or girls they are special for me and i want know more about him. ",3,1,459

But, a lot of this exposure is good. We're exposed to different cultures at an early age, we have easier access to education, and we know when disaster strikes, it's our responsibility to help. Because of all this new exposure, students often make commitments over the summer. Students accepted into college summer programs go to learn more about something their interested in. Some make the world a better place by doing service with a church group or other organizations. College is expensive, so a large quantity of teenagers get a summer job to save up money.

A4ADCC04C319,"Concluding Statement.
Summer projects should be teacher-designed because they know how to motivate and advise students. Teachers are always seen as inspirations because of all that they do. Therefore, taking away their right to make summer projects for students would negatively influence society because they would feel unappreciated. Additonally, the way classrooms run would be completely transformed. Overall, this topic will always remain an important topic because it reflects personal opinion.    ",1,2,71
A4E6E2D5658D,"Conclusion.When people think of summer they think of fun, traveling, relaxation, and most importantly no school work.

Students work tirelessly all year, summer is students' free time, and if students have to work during their free time it should be under their regulation what their assignments consist of.

Students creating their own assignments can be more enjoyable, stipulating their interests and help them learn information and lessons.

School projects over the summer assigned by teachers can come in bulk and most of the time is boring.

But, if students developed their own assignments for the summer then it could possibly be more enjoyable and help them learn more, for example a student would enjoy creating a graphic image project of information versus writing a paper that a teacher would normally assign.

Allowing students to take the lead and create their own projects can relieve the stress of summer work by them making it pertain to their interests.

In addition to an interest increase comes a comprehension increase, because students who enjoy more comprehend more. ",3,2,175

Education has always been a field where curiosity, and desires to innovate have been facilitated to bring about improvement in society. We can't always judge the circumstances to which things are, without providing a valid solution as to how those things ought to improve. Summer projects is that annual cycle where this principle can be enacted in the future. Projects designed to be student oriented can reinvigorate that desire for young people to go research and explore, while shattering the illusion of what education is depicted to be in America. What better way can we allow the continuous process of learning over the summer, than by putting the keys of that exploration in the hands of the future generation? ",1,2,146

AB02689C1A9B,"Conclusion.In Germany, residetns have given up on cars. Vauban's streets are completely ""car-free"", except the main throughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge are only two places to park.

70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and the 57 percent sold a car to move there. Some say they feel happier now than before when they had a car. Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. Greenhouse gas emissions are reduced drastically. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the U.S.

In the new approach to make cities denser, and better for walking stores are being placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. In teh U.S., the Enviornmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legistors are starting to act, if cautiously. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other tansport.

After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters, an international news agency headquartered in London; 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.

President Obama's goal to curb the U.S.'s greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week. Recent astudies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

ABF484B46756,"Conclusion.According to Brian Scott, an expert on youth development at the University of Social Sciences, extracurricular activities in school are some of the best ways that the youth can prepare to enter the working world. Scott explains that this is true because after school activities give kids further experience with important skills such as communication and team work. Furthermore, a study conducted by the Department of Youth Development found that 87% of adults who participated in extracurricular activities in school thought that being in an extracurricular activity gave them skills that helped them later in life. One possible reason why extracurricular activities could have helped people after they have completed their schooling experience is that it gave them important skills and character traits such as perseverance or good communication. All things considered, extracurricular activities give those who participate quality life skills. ",3,2,142
ABF484B46756,"Conclusion.Evidence for this is found by the University of Statistics who conducted a study that found that 76% of people who were a part of extracurricular activities during their school experience thought that the experience from those clubs is helpful to them in their careers. Some ways that clubs can help in careers is it can give students experience in their chosen career path. Examples of clubs that are best at providing experience specific to future careers is the math club where students can participate in competitions or the newspaper club where students can practice for journalism. The experience students gain from joining extracurricular activities in school can also be helpful when applying to colleges, if students choose to go down that route. According to the board of applications for the prestigious College of Law, one of the top things they look for in an application is what extracurricular activities the applicant participated in while in school. One member even said, ""I value extracurriculars even more than the grade point average when I am decided who gets in."" ",3,2,180

It won't be a good project because teachers will start to get tired which will result in errors on the project, which is why students should make their own project. students designing their own project will also give teachers extra time to do other things. while the students are coming up with ideas on what the project should be about teachers will have time to grade all the other work the students have.

AD3FFB7CA387,"Conclusion.One of the largest issues for parents in today's world is trying to get their children away from the computer, television, and cell phone. Technology has lessened the need for toys and books, since children entertain themselves with games on their tablets or books they download also on the tablet. But cars play a big part in this. When a person first gets a car, he/she feels free. You feel like the world is yours because you can go anywhere. But the problem is that people become less social with cars. Instead of going to play a sport with some friends, most people would rather drive somewhere else. It is also the reason the United States is ranked second in country with the most overweight people, vehicles are so unexpensive here that anyone is able to purchase a car and drive to their destination instead of riding a bicycle or skateboard and getting some real exercise. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks"" (Selsky 28). This also shows the improvement on the cities' sidewalks and the increase of people attending parks. Without cars, the streets look better and people recieve more exercise. ",3,2,206
AD3FFB7CA387,"Concluding Statement.In the end, cars are still one of the most common and one of the greatest things on Earth today. Getting a first car is a dream come true, but too much of it can be harmful. So get some use out of the bicycle, avoid poisoning the atmosphere, and cars will be a vehicle with no reprocautions at all, and it will be the perfect source for transportation, while keeping your morals where they should be.

AE37AE3F79C7,"Conclusion.After the school year ends, students return to their homes feeling a great sense of relief that the school year is over, and that they're about to get a much needed break. However, just because school has stopped doesn't mean that learning should. Three entire months off is long time, and many students actually forget most of what they learned over the past year and need to be refreshed when they return to school. It would save everyone a lot of time if students came back to school with the last year's information still fresh in their minds. The simple solution to this problem is summer assignments. ",4,2,108

Maybe if i didnt i would be able to undertand this a little more but this is so ridiculous that i have to sit here and take time away from my education to write about cars. Im not even into cars. i dont care that people decide not to use cars, good for them, but i do use a car on a daily basis. im so over all of this excessive testing. Cars are pretty and nicely air conditioned, and shiny. They get you where you need to be quickly and you can jam out while on the way there. I hate essays, they are obnixious and boring. this is all a huge waste of time and i wish i just stayed home like some of the other kids in this class so that i wouldnt have to take this. Cars can be a nice way of driving around in money bags and showing everyone that you can afford this unnessacarily large vehicle that will sit in the hot room connected to your house, that also has a tempature very similar to hell.

This is especially important for summer projects because many students in the summer do not want to do any school work, so a teacher assigning a student another forced project would not motivate them to complete it, while if the student got to design it themselves, they would be more interested and likely create a better project while learning more. Teachers do have the ability to design a project that students would enjoy, but the student-designed project truly allows for more learning by the students because it is more entertaining and an overall better experience.

B437EB073109,Conclusion.today i'm going to give you three reasons why it's a challenge to explore venus. ,5,1,16
B437EB073109,Conclusion.my first reason is because venus is a very very hot plant ,0,0,13
B437EB073109,"Conclusion.it's the second planet away from the sun but it is also considered our planet, earth's, ""twin"" among other things the reason why it's considered our second planet is for density and size also distance. ",3,1,36
B43F583ECE54,Conclusion.Being exposed to this type of activity from a young age will ensure your success in later years. ,5,2,19
B43F583ECE54,"Concluding Statement.School offering a variety of mandatory extracurricular actives is a great idea. This way students can learn important life lessons while doing something they enjoy. These actives teach children important lessons from knowing how to handle losing, communication with others, and even how to respectfully settle an argument. Being exposed to this type of activity from a young age will ensure great success in later years of life. ",1,2,70
B45B48157399,Conclusion.One reason why schools should use facial action coding system because it can be use full for health classes ,0,1,20
B45B48157399,Conclusion.My Second reason why schools should use facial action coding because a day on a test. A day on a test you'll have a emotion that you don't wanna take it or just too lazy to do the test ,0,1,40
B45B48157399,"Conclusion.might end up the person guessing all the problems and not even caring. The next day they would see there scores in the test and be embarassed because they got there score low. 
",3,0,34
B45B48157399,Conclusion.My Third reason why schools should use facial action coding because incase of a fight. People might be angry and might take there anger away on someone else ,0,0,29
B460B20EE678,"Conclusion.What is the closest planet to Earth? The Evening Star give us the brightest light. The closest planet to Earth is Venus. As human studies, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. Humans study more and more about Venus everyday. ",4,0,47
B460B20EE678,"Conclusion.Today, solar systems are useful on Earth. ",0,1,8
B460B20EE678,"Conclusion.Today, we're using computers, cell phone or tablat with solar. The author says, ""By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces,"" (paragraph 7). Humans are still working on Venus to get more powers, even though we got lots of power from Venus already. ",3,1,55
B4C4BABFB290,"Conclusion.There are many students who can get lazy when they come home from school. Most of the time, I can be one of those students. Usually when I come home after school, I always get the urge to jump on my bed and just watch videos on my phone. When I get on my phone, I can get so invested in it, that I don't even realize I have a lot of homework assignments to do.

Being lazy is just unhealthy for your body and mental health. Most students probably have been in the same situation as me. Although, if those students were to be in a extracurricular activity, they would be more productive. For example, an activity like playing soccer can help someone's brain/and body to be more active. Another example would be participating in any art-related activity, which can help students think more creatively. Doing any extracurricular activity would be way better than to sit down and watch on a device. ",3,2,164
B4C4BABFB290,"Conclusion.There are some students who might not have any activity or hobby they're passionate in. If those students had to take an extracurricular activity, they would have a more chance of finding something they like. Some students might even end up liking an activity they never thought they would. Every school gives many options in extracurricular activities. If a student tries out an activity and they don't like it, they can always try a different one. Also, another benefit in finding a activity you like, is getting a lead to a career you might want to have in the future. It's always good to know what you're passionate in, so you can have more options for future careers. ",3,0,119
B4C4BABFB290,"Concluding Statement.There may be other ways that extracurricular activities can benefit students, but the reasons I thought of were the most important to me. With extracurricular activities students can be more productive, find an activity they might be passionate in, and make new friends. Also, extracurricular activities can play a important role in life by leading you to a career. For the students who don't agree in partaking in any activity, just keep in mind that It's always better to try new activities because you might end up liking it!  ",1,0,91

B5A5CFDCE29E,"Conclusion.By the teacher designing it, it means she/he is giving them the information on what they should be working on. By them giving the information students can or will find it easy to do and finish them fast so they can have the rest of the summer for them. ",3,0,50
B5CA9C10711C,Conclusion.Teachers should be designing these summer project ,5,0,8
B5CA9C10711C,"Conclusion.People who believed that the summer projects should be student designed may argue that student designed projects will encourage for more participation, due to the fact that these projects will have a more simple design and be more easier to understand. ",2,2,42
B5D9F34D2CAC,Conclusion.Have you ever wondered what it is like in Venus and how we might be able to study more about it. ,4,0,22
B5D9F34D2CAC,Conclusion.There would be all sorts of information if we studied Venus closely. There are a lot of problems but it is still possible. ,0,0,24
B5D9F34D2CAC,"Conclusion.There are a lot of people that wants to know more about Venus. For example on paragraph 4 it states that, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This is stating that Astronomers know that one day Venus will change and humans will be soon able to land on it without much difficulties. ",3,0,68
B5D9F34D2CAC,Conclusion.This is stating that Venus could return or we can make it return to how it was originally and possibly live on it. This is a good reason I think Venus will be able to accept humans and find more facts and informations. ,3,1,44
B5DBDEBA4B23,"Conclusion.we are kiling ourselfs and we are ignoring that fact if we dont change then we are all done for.

at the end of the day if we as a speesies dont change we are never going too help this world survive. we need to open ou eyes to what we are doing and not to sound like the preacher, see the arre of our ways. if we dont do that futer generations will never make it, us as a speaseas will not survive. we need to stop fooling around and get serious we arnt kids anymore. me us we you need to change but hey no one ever read this anyway.      ",3,1,113
B64326635AB6,Concluding Statement.In conclusion I do think its a good idea for people to keep studing venus. My first reason was because it could give the scientist more information on the plant. My second reason was they might find some useful information that coild help them. My last reason was venus might not be a dangerous place as people make it out to be. So i think this is why some scientist should study venus more. ,1,0,76
B6B2D2FC8F3D,"Conclusion.they may not have the money to participate, ",0,2,9
B6B2D2FC8F3D,"Concluding Statement.although I would respect the principal's ultimate decision, I disagree with her statement. Students should not have to be involved in an extracurricular activity. They should be able to choose if they want to participate in an activity. Ultimately, the students choice should be prioritized, because they know their own strengths, and there are a couple reasons to support my claim. The student may not have the money to do so, it may be out of their comfort zone, and lastly they may not have enough time, and forcing them to participate in an activity would bring stress onto their shoulders.         ",1,2,103
B6B7196E454E,"Conclusion.It says in the text that ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" It also states that "" On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahernheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own plantet."" This proves that it would not be worth going to Venus ",3,0,76
B6F03D0CEABE,"Concluding Statement.Schools have to understand students better. With summer based projects being designed by the students they are able to have some fun doing it while also learning skills that are needed for both in school and out. Doing so helps them learn how to be independent and makes it so teachers will let them as well. So I do think that summer projects should be made by the students, because it helps them to learn independence, know when to take a break, and then let teachers know that they can do it but a little help at the start doesn't hurt.  ",1,2,103
B709F976724E,Conclusion.If you show the teacher with the exicting face you show the teacher that you don't understandnd but you show he teacher a couple smile you can make sure that you understand the lesson. ,0,0,35
B709F976724E,Conclusion.And the teacher should have that technology to help student ,0,0,11
B8476CE22AF9,"Conclusion.""The challenge of studying Venus"" is a very interesting story. In the story the author tells us a lot about Venus and its harsh conditions. The title describes the story very well. ",4,0,33
B8476CE22AF9,"Conclusion.In the article he writes "" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" Again he is describing Venus to sound like an awful place, so why would you want to explore it. Another good claim he makes is that, ""since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.""

Why would you go explore Venus in a space craft if all of them were destroyed. If it where me i would not want to explore Venus, the author has given me plenty of reasons not to. ",3,2,98
B8476CE22AF9,"Conclusion.but here are the downsides to that. Venus now is not like Earth, it is more like a destroyed Earth. ",6,2,21
B867F487B9F3,"Conclusion.Personal automobiles and cars have played a major role throughout the world since the invention of the car in World War 2. Cars have been a very successful invention and many people drive their own every day on their way to work, school or other places their feet cannot carry them. Though the car has fulfilled its duties in making the lives of humans easier, it has also contributed to many negative events. For example, car emissions get trapped in the atmosphere and cause living things to breathe in dirty air around them. ",4,2,94

B87E8822B2D2,"Conclusion.Cell phones cause distractions while on the road. Drivers do not pay attention to the road, which causes accidents to happen. ",0,2,22
B87E8822B2D2,Conclusion.The most prevalent distractions are texting and talking on a cell phone while driving. ,0,0,15
B87E8822B2D2,"Conclusion.Even the act of just dialing a cell phone can be dangerous. This increases the crash risk by 3 times. This is one of the worst distractions drivers can have, Due to the fact that you are not paying attention to the road. The driver's hands are not on the steering wheel which causes you to lose control of your car. This increases the accident risk highly. This is only one reason why cell phone use while driving should be illegal. ",3,2,82
B87E8822B2D2,"Conclusion.This causes the same problems as just dialing a cell phone. Drivers are too busy focused on their screen to pay attention to the road. They are also too busy thinking about their responses and what to say to pay attention to other drivers on the road. Since it usually takes two hands to text, the drivers have no hands on the steering wheel. This distraction causes the most fatalities. This is according to a sign over I-355, which states, ""857 traffic accidents caused last year due to texting. This is just another reason cell phone use while driving should be illegal. ",3,2,103
B89BB1FC1E1F,Conclusion.This article tells us the challenges that venus has to lay for us but this auther has found the was we try to beat tose challenges like in section 7 last sentenes he say that if we can just fine the resouses to build somthing to hold that force that venus has we could fined a lot that we dont even know. ,4,1,63
B8B64FD4EF6B,"Conclusion.Advantage of limits on car usage and life goes on without car,car free cities in german suburb. these articles talks about how car is aint realy needed being use how now day peole and the article in german suburd,life goes on without cars discuss people given up on they car. there are only two places to park they have too it either you park at the edge of the development garage or buy a space for 40,000 along with home.

B8EAF80A1409,"Conclusion.Many students dislike completing summer projects during their vacation time. After working hard in school, they look forward to relaxing and giving their brain a rest. It is vital that we do not mentally burnout, however, it is also important that we keep our brain somewhat active during summer break. This is why students are often given summer work. There are many different types of summer projects. Some projects are more traditional, being solely focused on reading and writing. On the contrary, some assignments are hands on, designed to test students' creativity. ",4,2,93
B8EAF80A1409,"Conclusion.some people may think that students would create less overwhelming assignments, ",0,2,12
B8EAF80A1409,"Concluding Statement.Summer projects should be teacher-designed in order to set up students for success in the long run. Everyone deserves a chance to succeed, and student-designed projects can harm this potential success. Even though some people think that students would create less stressful work, teachers should design summer projects to ensure that they are difficult enough, genuinely worth spending time on, and quality preparation for kids to thrive in class. It is important to be independent and take initiative, but it is more important to live a fulfilling life. ",1,2,90
B90C8C40C0A0,Conclusion.they have the opportunity to showcase their creativity and passions through the project they complete. ,0,2,16
B90C8C40C0A0,"Conclusion.In order to be most successful, students should have authority to be creative and responsible for their summer projects. ",0,2,20
B90C8C40C0A0,"Conclusion.Summer projects purpose is to continue the growth of your mind when you are out of the classroom for about 90 days. A lot can happen to adolescents over the summer, a lot of things that anyone who is not in the same phase of life can truly understand. Many teenagers find sanity with their peers and friends in this time frame of growing up. As seen and extensively studied by Erik Erikson, Erikson came to the consensus that when you are going through the school-age stage of life you begin to pull away from your parents and adults to find yourself and find your independence. In result, you grow more drawn to your friends and peers, due to them understanding the phase of development you are going through. The connection students have with each other is something that can not be matched by teachers. No matter the background or clique a student is in they all have one major characteristic in common that connects them, they are all students. Teachers have not been in school in years and they don't connect with the same things as this generation does. Teachers did not have the same technology, pop culture, or even the same societal standards as today students have. ",3,2,210
B90C8C40C0A0,"Conclusion.Throughout my school years, I find myself stressed and concerned every year when I receive a new teacher, after a long and carefree summer. The teachers have so much faith in their coworkers and the retention of the knowledge that according to them ""we should have learned in years past."" They begin to assign ""easy"" and ""refresher"" work that they assume we have been taught. The lack of communication between teachers is a hard burden on students due to their past teachers exclaiming that ""you do not need to worry about that, your teacher next year will teach you,"" and your present teachers thinking that you had already learned it in your past courses. As the student, you are left with the sense of delusion and dissatisfaction on why you lack this important skill and learning target. You struggle to understand basic fundamentals of learning and when you are assigned a project you begin to sweat the little gaps in your learning. Every student knows this feeling of remorse of being assigned a project on material you just havent been taught yet. Students who design the projects know what they and their peers have been taught and what they all lack because they have all endured the same classes and teachers. ",3,2,214
B91B697EB28E,"Conclusion.but a paying a 22-euro fine, which is 31 dollars in america, doesn't sound quite convinient. ",6,0,17
B91B697EB28E,"Conclusion.This what the city of Paris did to all owners of a cars who were told to leave there cars at home and refused to do so. Apperently, around 4,000 drivers were fined, and around twenty-seven cars were impounded to the people that had attitudes or strong reaction to there fine. Now in my opinion, do you seriously want to get risked and get your car taken away or pay a fine? Most likely no right? If you were told to leave your car at home for everyones own good, just leave it, save 31 dollars in yoiur pocket, maybe even buy a chicken or something right? ",3,0,109
B91B697EB28E,"Concluding Statement.My conclusion to all this for all of us to take a stand and try to limit car usage in all over the world atleast for a day, or be something like the city of Vauban, Germany, in which they have banned cars in a big part of the city, known as ""smart planning"". As I said in the begining, cars can be a fun thing to be riding around in, but they are on of the main reasons why pollution and smog is being created and becomeing a threat to all of our sociebty of today of all over the world. So yes, this my opinion, which should aslo be yours, we all should have a serious limiting in cars before everything get out of hands and its to late. If you can ride a bike, then ride a bike. if you can go walking to your job, school, home, or anywhere, go walking. Try to avoid car usage when its really not needed, and quit being lazy and start walking.                     ",1,0,174
B9347CDF2461,Conclusion.Technology has also clutched us with Bluetooth if you need to stay in communication just use Bluetooth and make a phone call instead which is completely easier than sending a text anyway because its faster and you can get responses much quicker than you could with a text message. Reality is one text or call could wreck it all. ,3,2,60
B94059412B2C,Conclusion.One of the disadvantages in a required school activity is that people might not have enough time to do things they normally do. ,0,2,24
B94059412B2C,"Conclusion.If we take an extra course, there might not be enough time to finish all our homework. When I get home, I have a substantial amount of homework to do, and I have to practice the sports I play. My schedule is already full. homework takes me the longest to do. I work on my homework thoroughly. I try to make sure there isn't any mistakes. When I do this, I'm more likely to pass the test because of how much thought and time I have put into my work. I describe this as my work ethic. My homework takes me about two to four hours at most and it takes up most of my schedule. The sports that I play take two hours. With a total of seven hours at most, I can never seem to fit anything else in my schedule. This might be surprising for other people but this is the daily schedule for average students and most students might have more to do. If we even tried to do an extra activity than we wouldn't be able to finish all of our work efficiently and properly. Adding another thing to do every day would throw off our work ethic and our grades would most likely go down. Time has such a drastic effect on us students because it can be hard to manage. Our parents, for example, suffer from time management along with us. If we all do an extra activity, then that means that school is extended another few minutes. This is hard for our parents who pick us up after school. They have to find another time to pick us up which can be stressful since their schedule is as cramp as ours. We are not able to participate in an extra curriculum because of the amount of time that we don't have, and even if we were able to, there might not be any other options. ",3,2,324
B94059412B2C,"Concluding Statement.There is more to just being tired, time management, and interest. We are not going to gain anything from the classes and we will certainly not approve of it. Making after school clubs required creates more problems, Not just for the students and teachers, but for the whole school. Think about what you would gain from the extra school classes, and how easy it is to get that experience by a different, easier method. Our schedule is so cramped we can't add anything else. Some of us might not have like any classes that are provided. Almost all of us would be tired from all the new things we have to do. Think about how tired you would be, and how much time you really have, because extracurricular activities should not be required. ",1,2,135

It was just interesting to read about how it was so much different then what is on Earth then it was on Venus. Venus is 90 degrees more hot then what it is here. In that case the heat up there is definaly more powerful then what it is on earth. The author was testing many of different kinda examples to test them. The author has put everything in the right order so that it easyer to understand how it's going. ,3,0,103

The number one way we know it is a land form and not something created by Aliens is because As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, he added. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!.

BDC4070CF21E,"Conclusion.Although, the teacher is responsible for teaching the class, the student is responsible for knowing which areas they need improvement on. Every student is different, one student may find challenging, another may find it easy. For example, in my geometry class, most students find proportions simple, whereas I find them rather complex and challenging. If I were to design my own summer assignment for geometry, I would include a lot of proportions to ensure I get the needed practice. This is just one of the example of how students know where they need improvement and how a student can help promote their own success. ",6,2,105
BDCD981437BB,"Conclusion.The Great Gatsby , a book that takes place in the 1920s, is about a rich man and the times of the stock market crash, among other things. Gatsby is a mysterious man who is hard to come by. Gatsby throws parties in his enormous mansion, and everyone human possible is invited. As time passes, he stops throwing these parties, and he is not heard from for a significant amount of time. The man could not withstand the massive amount of pressure of the parties; every individual expects the greatest out of Gatsby, but the stress that it all brings him results in isolation, especially with the Great Depression playing a large role. If students have the ability to produce their own projects and not have such high standards coming from a teachers standpoint, the students will have less stress and be able to find work that is compatible with their abilities ",3,0,152
BDCD981437BB,"Conclusion.A great example of this circumstance would be from the book

Divergent , written by Veronica Ross. In this novel, the main character, Tris, undergoes a significant change in her life; switching factions. The system does not choose for the individuals, every individual has the right to choose accordingly among a set of factions. The ability that one has to make the decision for themselves allows them to be comfortable with a future lifestyle that results in new friends, family, and the way of life. Students being able to personalize how they are going to perform the project, whether or not it will involve partners, and the form of work given will result in students being at a higher level of comfort than if a teacher were to produce the project top to bottom, not knowing if students will be satisfied or comfortable. ",3,2,143
BDCD981437BB,"Conclusion.Students have the tendency to not to things if told by another individual, but when the idea is introduced by oneself, the individual is more inclined to do it.

The Hunger Games is a novel that displays a similar effect; being based off of a numerous amount of decisions that could either end up in an individual's death, or survival, a certain scene in this book depicts the choosing of a weapon. The main character, Katniss, chooses a bow and arrow, being a weapon that the character has a great strength in and has a higher chance in succeeding with it. Having the ability to choose and having a personalized approach to the task makes one's task more likely to be completed with great excellence, especially if the individual personalizes the project to aid their strengths rather than their weaknesses. A teacher would not be able to identify a student's weaknesses, resulting in a weaker result than anticipated. ",3,2,159
BDCD981437BB,"Conclusion.Summer break is called a break for a reason, and if teachers assign projects that are more time consuming than anticipated, the time that students are given would be wasted. For example, an individual that brings similarity to the topic is Frederick Douglass. Frederick Douglass is an inspirational figure in America's History. The man wants the abolition of slavery. By fighting for his beliefs and going through excruciating pain by his slaveholders, Douglass becomes more and more passionate about gaining the freedom that the man and every other slave deserves. With the ability to control one's own life and decisions, one will have more freedom and space to breathe. Giving students the opportunity to customize the projects to a more time conservative approach aids in both the learning experience because the work is still getting done accordingly, and there is still time reserved for a summer break that the students deserve and should be able to fully enjoy.

PROPER_NAME made some adjustments to her summer plan so that she could get the work done but had to miss out on getting a job this summer. We as students all have things to do just like adults.

""Watching younger kids may be difficult sometimes,"" she said even with the very little down time she had she wanted to go out with friends and play basketball. The school work that was assigned to her took away her time of doing what she loved when she was not watching her siblings.

They will produce better results when given freedom and are made to feel like their opinion actually makes a difference.

BFC824D7C408,"Conclusion.Being able to do something which one is passionate about results in the best work that he/she can produce, this is because learning is driven by motivation. When a teacher assigns something for the student to do, he/she does not have an eagerness to learn because of the fact that it is something they don't have a strong passion for. When students are given an opportunity to produce their own projects, their minds open up and they begin to think outside of the box, which results in true creativity. School is based on a set curriculum and students have no input on what they learn and how they learn it, as a result, students lack effort and motivation to learn. Giving students an opportunity to create will eventually lead to increased productivity in later life One example of this is when adulthood hits and students are required to develop a skill set. Students are never given the opportunity to learn individually and this causes students to become dependent on others to feed them knowledge and information, therefore, students will only learn when they are demanded to. Having the freedom to create will give students their best opportunity to learn, whereas when they are not able to design certain projects, their goal shifts from learning to completing which will result in the content not actually being analyzed and took in.

Venus is close to earth witch makes itthe twin like in terms of density and size its close but distant a little from venus. So say if we get close to the sun earth woukd basically be like venus. Venus and earth is right around the corner from eachother so wat makes it different from eachother shouldnt the earth be hot too. To really think about it hot would it be if we were like venus.

The atmosphere is 97 perdent of carbon dioxide blankets venus which could really explain where the heat come from or take place in. Theres acid in venus atmosphere the pressure is 90 times worst than what it would usally be on earth. Its over 800 degress on that plante which makes it a baby sum or the son of sun.

People tend to forget that not all teenagers come from the same mentality of not being hard workers or not smart enough, every person in this world has their own intelligence within themselves, people just tend to forget and start to believe that they don't have a smart mentality. If teachers can have enough trust in their students and be willing to ask them for help, then that should be a sign that summer projects can be student designed.

They are not receiving any new information, but on the contrary, if they were exposed to a new topic and researched about it, they would be able to retain new information and learn more. It could lead the students to more success to; if they are opened to new ideas and points of views, the student will learn more and be able to grow in knowledge rather than be stuck in the same perspective that they are in. For example, if a student was bias against the creation of country clubs and corporate made communities, but was to read about why those were created due to an assignment, he or she may have a shift in perspective and mind. This does not apply that he or she has changed their mind, but it has opened up their knowledge and gave them a fuller picture rather than it magnified.

Regardless, if students like the subject of research, or not, that practice will help them grow in writing, reading, and critical thinking skills as well. This increase in knowledge applies to when the teacher is designing the assignments. ",3,2,207

C7FA88E9DF3B,"Conclusion.Have you ever been assigned a project that you did not want to work on? This regularly happens to many students, due to a variety of reasons. Although summer projects are slightly different than those assigned during the school year, they cause similar problems. The student might have been lazy, did not have enough time to work on the project, or the topic did not interest them. While schools cannot help much with the former two reasons, they can with the latter reason. Teacher-designed projects can be biased, affecting the student's ability to gain a wide understanding of a topic. Additionally, teachers tend to assign projects on topics that students do not see much importance in, as the topic does not seem to affect the student in any way. ",4,2,130

C7FA88E9DF3B,"Conclusion.However, by allowing summer projects to be student-designed, teachers do not have to come up with a topic themselves. Additionally, they are exposed to a wide variety of projects, allowing them to be more interested in the presented material. This allows teachers to be more likely to grade the projects fairly, as they do not have to repeatedly look at the same information. ",6,2,64
C7FA88E9DF3B,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion, self-designed projects allow students to be passionate about the topic, resulting in the creation of better projects. Students can demonstrate their creativity, allowing them to effectively retain the learned information. They also become more self-reliant, which will help them when they get a job. Rather than assigning teacher-designed projects over the summer, schools should assign student-designed projects to stimulate learning, as well as shape students to gain skills that will help them succeed when they become an adult.

CA5DB05415A5,"Conclusion.This usually occurs in teenage age groups who have a commitment to checking their phones while driving. Teenagers assume that by taking their eyes off of the road for solely two seconds, they aren't putting themselves or anyone else in danger. In reality, distracted driving via cell phone use ""reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent,"" (""Cell Phones""). Taking calls or texting confidently reduces a driver's ability to control a vehicle, respond to driving events, and direct attention to the roadway. This isn't the case for just teenagers. These conditions apply to every driver who attempts to use their cell phone while driving, thus creating a dangerous driving environment. People often drive with family members, close friends, or children in the car. The chance of a fatal crash because of distracted driving is high and it is very possible that these family members, close friends, and children could be injured or worse. It is much safer to restrict all phone use while driving in order to ensure that roadways remain safe. By not using a cell phone, a driver is better able to pay attention, less likely to crash, and following the law (""Cell Phones""). ",3,2,202
CA5DB05415A5,"Conclusion.it is a more viable and safe practice to prohibit its use until a person it not behind the wheel of a vehicle. A person only puts themselves in more danger, even when doing something appropriate with a cellphone when operating a vehicle, by trying to utilize it and maintain focus on the road at the same time.

CC82A1D80D1A,"Conclusion.A small suburb in Germany on the France and Swiss border have given up on their cars. ""Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in the experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg."" The streets of this small town are car free. The twon offers a tram that runs through the downtown, and a few small streets on one edge of the community. The town cannot bain cars altogether, but if you own a car the only place to store it is in large garages at the edge of the town. One space can cost $40,000, the cost of the space comes with the home. Only 70 percent of the population in Freiburg owns a car and 57 percent sold there vehicle before moving. Germany isn't the only country with this type of movement. The United States is promoting ""car reduced"" communities. This will cause increase demand of public transport to the suburbs surrounding big cities such as Chicago and New York.

Paris, however, is the first city to prohibit driving altogether. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial drribing ban to clear the air of the global city. Drivers where asked to leave their cars at home or risk a fine of 22 -euro ($31). Almost 4,000 drivers where fined. Diesel fuel was blamed becuase France has a tax policy which promotes diesel fuel. Almost 70% of drives have diesel vehicles. Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, but exceptions where made for hybrids and electric vehicles. The public transit was free of charge during the bane.

""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emission, unveiled last week."" American now is has fewer car sales, people driving less, and there are fewer and fewer liscences each year. Americas love of motor vehicles seems to be subsiding. People are driving about as much as they did in 1995 which is 9% lower then the peak in 2005. Some people may blame the lack of cars and driving on the reccession. On the other hand people were buying less cars two to three years befor the reccession even hit. If this pattern presists sociologist believe it will be eneficial for cabon emissions and the enviorment. This is becuase transpertation is the 2nd leading cause of carbon emission. This could have negitive effects on the automotive companies but they are already rebranding themselves as mobiltiy companies. This allows them to have a broder range of personal vehicles. Cities like New York have established a bike sharing program. This allows people access to bikes accross the city instead of taking a taxi. Many of the young people accross the country have not even bothered to get driver's liscenses. Driving decreased by 23% between years 2001 and 2009. They instead plan activites where they can walk or ride a bike.

For most of my life, I thought the projects that were given to us during our summer break, was outrageous and too time consuming. Looking back at things now, if it wasnt for those summer projects then I wouldnt have been as prepared as I have been to proceed onto the next grade level. Students tried to protest against not having summer projects at all, but that idea was shut down fast. Instead, the board of education agreed to hold a national vote on whether or not the summer projects should be student based or teacher based. If the projects are teacher based students wouldnt slack in order to get the project done they will actually complete it and teachers are trying to prepare you, they know the material best and are trying to provide materials they know you will need in order to be successful this coming year.

CF1345B5E224,"Conclusion.""All of our development since World war 2 has been centered on car,and that will have to change"" said David goldberg, an official of transportation for America. but nothing has gotten better since all this years. pollution of greenhouse gases in the uk are up to 12 percent and in the united states an estimate of atleast 50 percent in most car intensive areas. Mr. goldberg also stated ""how much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid"" which is also something that is not taken into account.

In paris there had a offical ban from drving your cars, people who were caught driving cars were fined up to 22-euro($31).Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emisssions. Caris typically has more smog than other european capitals with paris having up to 147 micro grams of particulate matter (pm) per cubic meter compared with 114 in brussels and 79.7 in london, reuters found. Congestion was down 60% after just five-days of intensifying smog which even rivaled places such beijing and china.

Suburbs and cities are very wide leading to one of the main reasons for motored-vechile. But there have been efforts in the last two decades to make cities denser which have lead to greatly less car usasge. Places like vauban,home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile. Vauban having made its suburbs compact and public transportantion has lead to it being a very well success.

D1AF5CE5040E,"Conclusion.When students leave out of the school building doors for their summer break, I can promise you that the last thing they are thinking about doing is more work for their teachers. In different scenarios, It would be very convenient and unique for kids to continue their learning while enjoying their summer at the same time. They would go to school the next year and only need very little, if any, reminders of what they should've been learned the previous year. ",4,0,82
D1AF5CE5040E,"Concluding Statement.To ensure we would have less drop-outs, students who have failed for the year, or kids who simply do not understand the material, public schools should take part in making the project a requiremnt that students must complete a summer learning project of their desire, as long as it is something they know little about. The project is expected to be taken serious as an SOL would. It is a great way to make sure that students would not forget any knowledge over their summer. Also, it would be a great excercise for thier brains as well as it would get them ready for college if they plan on furthering their eduction. ",1,2,114
D1B06A3C02B3,Conclusion.Assigned schoolwork during summer break has been a widely debated matter for years. For both supporters and opposers of schoolwork being assigned during summer break begs a crucial question: Should summer projects be student-designed or teacher-designed? ,4,0,37
D1B06A3C02B3,"Conclusion.but various pscyhologists, notably Generic_Name, have disproved the claim, finding no evidence of maturity being linked to one's intuition or strive of creativity. In fact, this myth actually arose due to various reforms of the Progressive Era restricting children and immigrants' personal freedom, which continues to this day. Although many would deem this irrelevant, it is precisely the reason that we must not hold back to provide students with freedom in creating their own projects and avoid persisting a key issue.

D1B06A3C02B3,"Conclusion.Research conducted by various universities, such as the University of Chicago, has shown that students are not prepared for upcoming projects every time they complete a teacher-designed project; ",6,2,29
D1B06A3C02B3,"Concluding Statement.Simply put, very few communities should expect to carry out teacher-designed summer projects with pleasing results. As promising as it may seem, it is apparent that teachers should not be given excess loads of responsibility of their students, and it is time to allow the students to take their own approaches to their tasks and prepare them for what is to come. It is not a perfect idea, as no idea can be, but everyone must take steps to reach their end, even if it is gradual. If we are to see to the success of more students and further cememt the well-being of our educators, this is a crucial step that should be taken.          ",1,2,117

That would not be too fair for the students that deserve the break after having 9 months of constant learning and hard work in school.

Summer projects can be fun and it's a great way to help students from forgetting the information they learned in school. Having fun and getting some freedom is what makes summer so special to so many students all over the world.

You go up and tell the instructor that you can't run and they say, thats fine, but, the principal will be somewhat mad that you can't do the program. ""I guess i'll ask him to get you a different one this time.""Or what if you get stuck with a game like cricket.

Picking one thing out of so many different options can be hard but with variety there aren't very many repeats of the same thing, thats why when you choose something that interests you its the only thing there of its category, most likely because there are so many other options that theres no real reason for it to exist again and be the same thing. This happened to my mom when she was younger there was no real variety there were only 2-3 options to choose from and that was that. Nowadays when I'm choosing after school activities she tells me be wise because when she was younger she had barely as many as I do today.

""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,"""" (D'Alto 6). This exemplifies that the schools want to use this technology to help students learn more effectively by using technology thats like a teacher. For some students this may cause trouble if they make facial expressions, but it's not about the lesson. Such as if a student is told something by another student and the student looks confused, the computer might see that and think they dont understand the lesson. Then it would modify the lesson for the student even if the student understood it just fine. A teacher would be much better at understanding the students emotions in a certain situation than technology. ",3,2,146

DFD1805B8F93,"Conclusion.Venus is like earths twin. The author stated in where the plant is loctaed. Venus tempature on the surface is 800 degrees. NASA is wanting to send people to the planet venus.

NASA is wroking on other approachaes to studying Venus. They smiplified electronics that are made up of silicon. They are trying to make the modern day computers even faster then they are today. NASA trying to create a machine that well last long enough to contribute to Venus. Their wanting to make gear that also dont need electronce inquired.

People call Venus ""The Evening Star"" becuase it is one of the brightest spot in the night sky. Although people mistaken it for a star its a planet. Venus is safer to see from the distance its been very challageing to exmane Venus. This planet is the secound planet away from our sun. Venus is the closest size to earth.

The NASA is very facinated by Venus because is the most earth like planet. Venus surface is very rocky like valleys and mountains.

E36560297AD9,"Conclusion.Because teachers are more experienced with designing summer projects, they know what is needed to help students construct a great project. ",0,2,22
E36560297AD9,"Concluding Statement.Teachers can organize a summer project better than students because they are highly experienced in doing so. Teachers find ways to engage and challenge their students which leads to a higher passing rate. So while student-designed projects can be fun and easy, it's more effective when summer projects are teacher-designed. The biggest problem with teacher-designed projects is that not every teacher or student is the same, However teacher-designed projects are said to be more successful than student-designed projects. They are not always fun, but they are always effective. Teachers are always working to help students gain information and be successful in life. So next time you have a summer project and you want it to be student-designed, think about all the things your teachers do to make sure you are going to be successful. It isn't supposed to be easy, and it isn't always going to be fun, but as long as you learn the information, it will always be beneficial. ",1,2,163

If a student is giving off a false emotion than that student really feels; the FACS can determine the actual emotion the student is feeling. If teachers and parents realize the actual feelings and emotions someone feels, he or she will be able to provide more comfort in the act of helping towards that individual. ",3,2,117

EB763115B6CD,"Conclusion.You need to keep both hands on the steering wheel to be the most effective driver. But, every time you text, read messages or talk on a cell phone without a hands-free device, not only is your focus compromised, but you can't keep both hands on the wheel. Phone use when you are driving can also affect your alertness of the surroundings, which can make you prone to collisions. Also, distraction and inattention are the number one cause of traffic accidents and it is estimated that nearly every collision involves one of these two related errors. Driving takes all your attention and it is your responsibility to keep your eyes on the road, so put down the phones and pay attention to the road. ",3,2,125

Erratic driving patterns can be extremely dangerous to everyone else on the road, including other drivers, pedestrians, and animals. Also, motorist involved in a stressful or emotional phone conversation may exhibit aggressive behavior while they drive, such as road rage. This may cause the erratic driving to worsen and this greatly increases the chance of causing an accident.

EC3DD758D9F0,"Conclusion.also notable Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Mercury planet surface temperature averages over 8000 degrees Fahrenheit and the atomsphereic pressure that is 90 times greature than we experience on our planet and such an environment would even crush a subermarine that is made to explore the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. Venus has a thick atmosphere that is made of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide and blankets Venus. The most challenging are the clouds that are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus´s atmosphere. Venus geology and weather introduces natural disaters such as erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes, which makes it harder to land on Venus without experiencing one of these dangers.

ECD640058D57,"Conclusion.My Best Friend Generic_Name, had a teacher that liked her personality and the way she made people feel loved and included when no one wanted to. At the end of middle school, her teacher asked everyone to do a project. So for her project, she did it on one person which it was about her teacher. Her Spanish teacher, was strict on students but never lost faith in each student she had. But something about her made my friend and her have a connection. My friend has a mom that supports her in everything, but her Spanish teacher never had a kid. So my friend Generic_Name was like a daughter to her. She felt like she had a bond like her mom. Then one day for parent's night, Generic_Name's mom went to her Spanish class, and her teacher and her mom clicked away. They've became best friends out of no where. She was surprised because she didnt know if they would like each other or something she thought wouldn't work out. They've been friend's for 8 years already, and have so much in common. Her teacher was a person she can go for anything and without one question be afraid to tell her anything. So for her project, she did a poster of her mom and Spanish teacher. The connection they have, no one in the world could have that. Her Spanish teacher was important to her because she felt alone sometimes and had no one to talk to and she felt like she can go to her and talk about her problems with her. They have a bond she won't forget ever. She added pictures and saying thank you for everything for and nothing less. And for helping her in her rough days and making them somewhat better ",3,0,300

EDF7F5BCBD05,"Conclusion.Making extracurricular activities a requirement would cause people to join clubs without genuine interest in the activity. These students will show less enthusiasm and put in less effort towards club activities and can drag things down for other students. They could be unwilling to do work or serve as a distraction to other students. There is a similar situation in elective courses, where some students only select a course because they believe it will be an easy class. Those students tend to participate less or be loud and off-topic. During group projects, they don't contribute as much. For many other students, it is frustrating to deal with these people, especially since there is no common interest in the activity they are doing.

It was also referred as Earth's ""twin,"" since Venus is the closest with density and size in terms of Earth's. But, we really don't know alot about Venus. Now why is that we don't sent any rovers, satelites, ANYTHING to get some few informations about Venus for the last three decades?

Because anything that touched the surface of Venus surrvived less than three hours. Which gathered the reputation as the as the challenging planet to study. ",4,0,101
EE0229233F51,"Conclusion.But WHY is it worth studying it? Well, Astronomers are fascinated and interested in the past of Venus as many of them has theorized that might've used to be a lot like Earth from long time ago, with Venus used to oceans that support life like ours. Another reasons why it's worth the trouble and money to study it is that Venus could be our next Planetery visit as our nearest option. ",3,0,73
EE377D38C330,"Conclusion.A lot of people wonder how this works they don't really know that one easy way to show emotion or to show how you feel is by looking at them and looking at their actions. Once you have already seen them and that they are feeling some kind of way that's when you realize that there is something going on or that their sad or happy or that they are just going through stuff. People know that by the facial expressions on their face. They say that us as humans perform the same impressive ""calculation"". Some people struggle or have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried,sad,etc. ",3,0,113
EE377D38C330,Conclusion.but if they think about it instead of waisting your time just guessing what their emotions are you would know if they use the proper techonology. They had made a process that began when the computer constructed a 3-D computer model of the face and it showed that all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. ,6,1,61

EEC9540E73FD,"Conclusion.In fact, according to a study performed by Harvard University, almost 85 percent of students participate in after school activities that take up more than 8 hours of time per week. This would include practicing the activity and for many activities you would have to compete. For example, one of my friends, Generic_Name, does many activities. She plays on a competitive lacrosse team, she plays a musical instrument, and she takes all honor classes. She barely finishes all of her homework, and she has stupendous time management skills. If she had to take part in another after school activity, she wouldn't have time to do it all.

EFD99673780E,"Conclusion.Twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet snapping pictures of possible landing sites for Viking 2, then it spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end. It seemed to be staring back at the cameras on Viking 1. These photos were taken from the region of the Red Planet called Cydonia.

Viking 1 took a picture of something call a butte or mesa. They're most common in the American West. It's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on mars. Their is one in the Snake RIver Plain in Idaho.

On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.

""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 rimes larger than the pixel size. If there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" said Jim Garvin.

The picture actually shows is the Martian Equivalent of a butte or mesa. This landform is most common in the American west. ""It reminds me most of the MIddle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Jim Garvin.      ",3,1,246
F038426B8B5A,"Conclusion.If students are given the instructions and already know the idea it makes it a little easier to get done over the summer. Students tend to procrastinate and take their time, which they should, but that time may be at the last minute. It could be August and they have to go back to school that following week and haven't even came up with an idea yet. Teacher-based projects already have the idea and the instructions on how to do it and it saves time depending on the project. Students can still not do it at all but at least they have the foundation on what to do and start it and have it done with in weeks or days. ",3,2,121

F065FD9F8D5F,"Conclusion.When I learned vital concepts such as multiplication, the way my teacher taught was through constant out loud repetition of the material, which helped my classmates along, but not me. I needed to see the problem worked out and look at the numbers because I had trouble picturing all the math and numbers in my head. Not being able to understand that basic concept of multiplication was detrimental to my math abilities and led the following years of my math career to be absolutely exhausting. This same scenario could take place involving summer projects. A teacher could give a student a summer assignment to help them learn about a concept in that class, but if the design of the assignment was difficult for the student to understand, it could be more hurtful than helpful. The entire reason teachers and schools assign projects over the summer is to assure that students will continue to learn during their break, but how are the students supposed to learn if they can't understand or have trouble with the assignment? ",3,2,176
F065FD9F8D5F,"Conclusion.Projects are meant to provoke students to think, and having students design the project themselves is a great way for them to think more and therefore learn more. ",0,2,29
F065FD9F8D5F,"Conclusion.I don't remember the material from my psychology summer assignment this year. All we had to do was research and write about a basic concept from psychology. I do, however, remember the Latin project I did in seventh grade. I think this is because I was allowed to do the project on anything related to Latin that I wanted. All my teacher asked of us was that the project was somehow Latin related. I decided to do my project on ancient roman customs, specifically the different rituals performed as a person reaches certain ages. From that project I remember things like that at six months old a young roman boy gets a round pendant called a bulla to protect them from evil spirits and when they reach age twelve the receive a new type of toga and more. I could not tell you about the five methods of observation used in psychology, which is what my summer assignment this year (11th grade) was about. ",3,2,165

This also shows great potential to land a spacecraft there. ",3,0,54
F0740AF01F22,"Conclusion.The text states, ""Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent ligtning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" This shows that the weather conditions are similar, so this would help the manufactures of the spacecraft be prepaired for the conditions and help build a better craft.

F245631F4D97,"Conclusion.The Generic_School system as had tremendous amount of trouble in which teachers have to ask for multiple planning days. The reasoning for this is due to the fact that students don't knowing the fundamental requirements for a class when they walk into the classroom on the first day. This causes teachers to have to readjust their curriculum in order for the students to catch up to where the teacher wants them to be. A teacher-designed project would allow the teacher to tell the students the basic information they need to know before they come into the class, it also allows to students to prepare their mentality going into the school year.

F2C57EEEF02C,"Conclusion.Education is critical at any age, but especially to those who remain still in grade school.

F2C57EEEF02C,"Conclusion.Although many believe that these projects should be driven by the teacher, students should be the one to design these projects ",5,2,22
F2C57EEEF02C,"Conclusion.Over summer break, many students just want to be able to relax and not do work that they may have little interest in that has been assigned by their teacher. By having student-driven projects, it gives students an opportunity to create something that they are passionate about. This is important because when a student is passionate about what they are working on, it creates motivation for them to complete the assignment. A student is highly likely to complete an assignment that they are involved in because it is relative to their life. Many projects that are handed around by teachers have little to no relevance to the lives of students. If students get the opportunity to create their own assignment, they will feel a sense of pride because they are passionate about the topic. This leads to greater motivation internally for any student which leads to better overall results. ",3,2,150
F2C57EEEF02C,"Conclusion.By having little to no teacher involvement, it forces students to have to learn the material all on their own which has been proven that the student retains the information longer. This does not just help students for this topic, but helps them in life as well because if they are able to learn on their own they will be able to hold all of this information instead of just retaining it for one assignment and then being done with it after. In the end, student-driven projects causes students to better understand the material for not only one project. ",3,2,100

F3580A6BAFA8,"Conclusion.Passenger cars are rsponsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Source 1). Not many people think about the effects of air pollution like smog, but it is a big deal. Since people don't think about it often, there is no way for the majority of us to try and find a solution to put into action to stop it or help it go down. In Paris, there was a partial driving ban to clear the air around the city (Source 2). Paris' partial ban was their idea to try and make their city a better place. With the ban being enforced and put into play there  were about 4,000 drivers fined (Source 2). It turns out that since the driving ban was made the congestion, car traffic, had gone down 60 percent in the capital of France, just after five days of less smog pollution and Paris is typically known to have more smog than any other European capitals (Source 2). This goes to show, that slowly people are actually becoming aware of what's going on and they actually care enought to try and make things better. ",3,2,205

",0,2,35
F3928951775C,"Conclusion.Wrecks are things that claim the lives of people each and everyday. Some can be prevented, yet not all can. Think of how many lives are taken each day, due to wrecks because of things like congestion in big cities. Or even things such as someone behind the wheel who is stressed, and driving wrecklessly. A source from paragraph 3, states ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" Many people, get tense and stressed from the drivers around them. Limiting how much you use a car, can improve things such as stress levels. Imagine how much more at ease you would be if you constantly heard, a bicylest wizzing by you, or hearing children chattering and laughing among themselves, instead of hearing horns honking, loud motors, or even the sound of a car crash.

Roads and streets take up much more space than we think or even realize. With less cars on the road everyday and more people walking, or riding a bike, could only mean one thing; less roads and bigger sidewalks. More cities are trying to make limiting car usage a much bigger thing, ""...in attempts to make suburbs more compact..."" Source one, also states that ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather that in malls along some distant highway. (paragraph 6) ",3,2,232

F634BC92DC39,"Conclusion.Looking down at a cell phone for 5 sec while going just 55 mph means that you have just crossed the length of an entire football field without looking up at the road. The AAA Foundation For Traffic Safety ranked using a hands-free mobile device as a level 2 distraction and texting while operating a vehicle as a level 3 distraction, the highest level. Such distractions are unacceptable when operating a motor vehicle, it could lead to injuries or worse. A study conducted by Cambridge Mobile Telematics revealed that roughly 52% of drives that resulted in a crash were caused by distracted driving, and roughly eleven teens die per day as a result of texting and driving. Inexperienced drivers, such as teens, are more prone to engage in distracted driving, and are more likely to suffer a crash or accident when engaging in distracted driving. Having your attention focused on anything other than the road is a terrible and dangerous idea, and should not be tolerated under any circumstance. ",3,2,170
F634BC92DC39,"Conclusion.In 2016 alone, distracted driving took the lives of 3,450 drivers, and injured over 300,000 more. Using a phone while driving is a gamble with death. The CDC reports that nine people are killed and more than 1,000 people are injured daily as a result of distracted driving. Despite knowing these facts, many drivers still report that they engage in distracted driving, usually via phone. The individuals who choose not to use their phone while driving realize the consequences of distracted driving, and choose to seek the benefits of not using a phone while driving. Cell phone use while driving is a horrible practice. Sending a text is most certainly not worth a human life. 
",3,2,119
F634BC92DC39,"Conclusion.New laws or stricter punishments on these laws would likely reduce the likelihood that people would choose to text or call while driving. There are ways to prevent phone use while driving that do not necessarily involve government. Making sure individuals, especially teens, know the risks behind using a phone while driving can persuade them to stop or not start. For teens, stricter penalties from parents would also dissuade them. Give instructions to new drivers to specifically not get on their phone while operating a motor vehicle. ",3,0,88

F63F47E95B90,Concluding Statement.Overall i think that finding new ways to explore and studie venus is a great idea i think that will change history maybe in the future venus can become our second home if we find out more about it and venus will soon be an explored planet and hope that will continue with other planets. ,1,0,57
F647D77D7396,"Conclusion.Its 1983, the stickiness of your fingers still reminisce the apricot you ate earlier while the beating sun destroys the meaning for sunglasses. The thought of eighty-seven more days stuck in your families summer house somewhere in Northern Italy with nothing but books, music, and your bike makes the thought of going back to school almost exciting. While you lay on your chair that afternoon, you remember that your previous History teacher assigned a project on ""The Roaring Twenties"". To be true, homework did not seem the most appealing activity to accomplish during that hot summer day, never the less, you were meaning to get up and wash your filthy hands of apricot juice. The project consisted of a writing assignment and a piece of self-made artwork. While the assignment felt like it would take all summer to accomplish, all of your previous knowledge kept flooding back like school was just yesterday. With no library within a three-mile radius, there was no need. Your project was finished within a week and the rest of your summer was dedicated to lounging beside the lake near your house and your grandfathers old books he left behind dating back to the early 1900's.

F647D77D7396,"Conclusion.an abundance of notes for additional help, ",0,2,8
F647D77D7396,"Conclusion.During school holidays, teachers are unable to assign work or projects to students because their breaks are dedicated to leaving ones mind at rest. Though students are unable to receive work over short-term breaks, work over the summer is optional for most teachers. While a break from constant learning is needed for the mind to repair itself, stopping all academic thought can effect the students recovery back into their new school term. Summer assignments most often consist of a short paper or vocabulary words needed for the upcoming year, all achievable within a couple weeks. Not only does being able to accomplish such little work in such a large amount of time show responsibility but it also prepares the student for larger sums of upcoming work. ",3,2,127
F647D77D7396,"Conclusion.Students learn up to four units a year and are assigned up to two projects per unit. Within the year, students attend around 240 classes per-year in taking around 1,920 hours of learning. Within all of the lessons and assignments, one is able to remember an abundant amount of information per-unit, allowing a student to combine all work into a project. Assume a project was based on biodiversity of animals within the agricultural system. With knowledge from ones own memory combined with notes and previous assignments, a project that consists of a 500-word summery of biodiversity will seem like a quick explanation. Though many children around the world suffer from short-term memory loss or just have difficulty harnessing previous knowledge, additional help from previous worksheets to study from or a phone call to a friend that has the same assignment might be able to significantly give a boost of memory or a kick-start. If all is lost from the previous year and making a phone call is not an option, libraries and the vast online knowledge of the web can help support uneasy topics and questions. ",3,2,188

The article also mentions that each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photos. I think that this picture did really prove that the Face was only a landform and not some kind of martian marking. ",3,0,82

F7561C027920,"Conclusion.The biggest reason why these summer projects are created is so that students wouldn't lose the skills and knowledge from previous years that are need for their upcoming classes. If the students created their own summer projects, they would not lose those skills or knowledge at all. ",0,2,48
F7561C027920,"Conclusion.Teachers help them practice life skills with these projects as they could be long and tedious. However, students should have opportunities to build these skills themselves to prepare them for the upcoming school year and their future in general. Students who would work really hard on their own summer projects build their organizational skills as they plan out their assignments. Time management is another skill that is taken into these projects. Practicing time management prepares them for college and their future careers as deadlines can't be rearranged, and some tasks take more time than others. They would be able to schedule how much time in a day they can work on their summer assignments. Students who create their own projects also practice focusing and perseverance. There will be times where the project comes to a stand still in progress; practicing focus and perseverance encourages students to not give up on their projects and to make it the best it can be. In conclusion, students will prepare themselves for future tasks such as college projects and career projects when they create their own summer projects in high school. ",3,2,188
F76B24B4AB78,"Conclusion.When they called Venus ""Evening Star"" beacause during the evening you could see Venus so clear. The reason why you could seen Venus not just because how bright Venus was but also because Venus is closer to us then you think. BUt the point of the nickname is because Venus is a misleading panet in our solar system.

We say that Earth and Venus are twins because Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. People might think that when we say twins they might think that everything is the say on Venus but nobody know how Venus looks like because everytime we send the spacecraft in only last for a few hours. Never enough hours or days to see everything we want to see and view. The speed of Venus ""means orbit the sun at different speeds."" This probably mean why not spaceship don't last for very long in Venus.

F7F9EB5D0F2D,Conclusion.The author presents this idea as the main idea of the passage because Venus is sometimes called the evening star. This point is the one of the brightest in the night sky this makes even easy to spot for amateur stargazers to spot. This statement is misleading because it is actually a part of our solar system second planet from our sun. This star is great from a distance but it is a very meaningful cloud draped world. This planet may be bright we have sent many human organized spacecrafts never survived more than a few hours. ,3,0,98
F7F9EB5D0F2D,Concluding Statement.I would say the conclusion of this article is the image that the author creates in my mind of the worthy persuit also the destruction it could cause because of the corrosive atmosphere. The author supports the main idea really well with the content and details in this article. He makes it really interesting to create an image so horrible but make it were you beleive that the human race should want to go there. This article explains and gives ideas that tell you that you would want to risk your life there but also it would be hard to go there because of all the critical things that are on Venus. ,1,0,114

F86C71E10A78,"Conclusion.The final picture they took on April 5,1998, actually showed the Martain equivalent of a buttle or mesa. Buttles and mesas are landforms common around the American west. ""It reminds me most of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" says Garvin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa, about the same hieght as the Face on Mars.""

F8C22ACD1774,"Conclusion.The process of completing a project goes smoother when given rules to follow and, within those rules, allowing students to express themselves even more than that of a guideline-free project. ",0,2,31
F8C22ACD1774,"Conclusion.Many students would jump at the opportunity to get ahead on the information for the next school year and many may not enjoy the requirement, but appreciate the opportunity.

Giving clear instructions provides the structure to learn and get ahead before the race for grades begins.

A summer project in which the students are designing and planning does not insure they will continue to learn during their break, but instead assures teachers that students will attempt to make it as non complex and superficial for themselves as possible.

Providing students with the opportunity to design their project uniquely with no specifications needed enables them to be lazy in the creation of the project and miss critical information for the subject that the project is on.

Students come up with many ways to avoid in depth descriptions of a topic because of the lack of motivation to do so.

With clear instructions, students will be able to find the information the teacher wants and needs in order to grade the project, and the information needed to elaborate on this knowledge in the beginning of the school year.

Students want the ability to enjoy the summer and with the specific necessities for the summer project highlighted, they will not have the stress of creating a project from scratch. ",3,2,217
F8C22ACD1774,"Concluding Statement.summer is a time for rejuvenation and recuperation; therefore, requiring an abstract project during this time is inadequate to the idea that many students are unable to complete such a task based on prior engagements, no structural support to aid in finding information needed, and upholding the sole purpose of summer.

Students do not want the stress of the school year carried over into the summer and neither do teachers, for students may find the need to contact teachers about what they can and cannot do if there is not a rubric they are able to follow. ",1,2,99

F9238D9E5631,"Conclusion.students would be practicing for a future of independence, where they would be the main person dictating what their work should reflect. Students would have to practice planning ahead to ensure their work reflects their full potential, rather than rushing into work and creating something sub par. Another positive related to student-planned projects is that students would be more prepared for future experiences. Students would have an opportunity to lightly touch on skills required throughout adulthood and outside of school. They would be practicing time management as they plan for their project within their own schedule. Students would also be practicing self-reliance as their project would be fully based on their own efforts. Further, a student-designed project would reflect the student by what work they present. By choosing what they create, the student's the effort and energy put into the project would be represented in their work. It also shows their own work ethic, as the quality of the project would highlight how much they valued completing the project in a well-reflected manner. ",3,2,174
F9238D9E5631,Conclusion.Student-designed projects can lead to work created in better quality than projects that are teacher-designed. ,0,0,16
F9238D9E5631,"Conclusion.student-designed projects allow students to express their own creativity as they control the major factors that play into what makes up the project. Students would be choosing their own work, allowing them to more blatantly show their own ability through more preffered methods.

To extend on this, students would create better designed projects as they wouldn't feel pressured to follow an exact guideline to receive a high-scoring grade. Student-designed projects would allow more room for students to seek different opportunities to express themselves through their work. The lack of pressure could also mean the project would be overall more enjoyable for the student to complete, as it would be based off their own ideas and planning. ",3,0,117

FD562A12092E,"Conclusion.Students, after a tiring school year, want to relax during their summer break. By allowing students to design the project, they will create it in an uncaring way in order to get it over with. Students will not put the effort in both designing and finishing the project. This will create no benefit, growth, or thought in their education and academics. A personal example revolves around a project my English teacher once gave out. There was no prompt and no requirements other than a works cited. This created a hard time for students to figure out what they needed to do. As seen by this example, allowing students to design their own projects will create no benefit or direction. Without the direction of a teacher, students will not know what or how to do anything that is needed of them. ",3,2,141

04D653441263,"Conclusion.As a current student at a in person educational school, I have first-hand experience on how time consuming school may 6 be. An online education means that you are being told what you need to have done here before a certain time and, how you are expected to do so. It throws away the possibility of time consuming dialogue that students may have with other students or the teachers getting off topic with a personal story. Doing these little things that happen frequently can turn an 8 hour system into 3 hours. In the mist of giving these students 5 more hours in the day that is 5 more hours for students to work, hang out with friends, do chores and etc. These little things let us teenagers be teenagers just a little while longer.

If you let students text during free time, it could keep students from texting during class, and help them focus more. By distracting the students while they are outside or have free time, it could prevent them from doing something to get them in trouble. And less people would be angry.

We are also told the we have the freedom to vote once you reach certain requirements, like age and citizenship. However, are we really getting the freedom that is talked about? No. Because the Electoral College is present in today's society, our vote becomes pointless and meaningless.

That to me tells me that there could have been life on Mars at some point in time but we were probably not exsiting back in the time life could have been in Mars. Its just a mesa becuase on paragraph seven, first and secound sentence, it says, ""So on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharpers than the original Viking photos.

0628DB049A56,"Conclusion.We have to put faith in the electors we vote for,  this makes it less likely any of them are crooks. When people vote for an elector, they're voting for who they hope the president will be. While that may not always be the case, it's very likely the elector will vote for that candidate.

07397A3E9D8D,"Conclusion.Even from my own experience, when I'm given an assignment to do in class I finish it more quickly due to the resources I have in the classroom. When assignments are given at home, it takes me longer to complete this assignment because I tend to have lots of questions that can't be answered by my parents or the internet. Video chatting isn't the same as a face to face conversation with your teacher. What if the internet is down and you're not able to communicate with your online teacher, what do you do now? As a student, I know kids aren't going to try and solve the problem, this is just another excuse they can use to as why they did not complete their assignments. Attending class at home will cause more of a stress for students because they will find other things to do that can distract them from their work.

Unlike children with autism or special needs students with attention disorders take the same classes as the general population. Therefore students 504 plans are followed based on who the teacher is, and sadly some teachers dont care. This means the student will not receive any accommodations such as more time on test. This can lead to poor grades, and not because the student isnt prepared. A student with ADD will have to read a problem 5 times before they really retain the information and even then everything is done slower because when students with attention disorders try to force their brain work too fast that is when things are forgotten and missed.

09281EFF7A66,"Conclusion.Voters dont vote for a president,But for a state elector. The disaster factor is the best argument against the electoral college. The electoral college is irrational,outdated and unfair, And the arguments have pros that are assertions without basis in reality. The Electoral college is not democratic in a modern sense. The electoral college is also a anachronism. ",3,0,60
093BD0824B7E,"Conclusion.However, some may argue that some students will abuse this system so they could stay home because they wish to skip class and be lazy or maybe just want to stay home. ",2,2,33
09483BB18BC3,"Conclusion.The electoral college has existed since the founding fathers established it in the consistution as a way to elect a presedential canidate. What the electoral college is, it is a ""compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" What the electoral college does instead of electing a preseident through a popular vote, it is electing through a electoral vote, that means if you are voting your votes are actually counted towards the electors of the canidates. Each candiate has it's own slate of electors, in wich you are voting for them, and they will make the decision of deciding who is president of the U.S.

A presidential canidate can have more popular votes then the other candiate, meaning votes favored by the people, but if a president has more electoral votes, which is votes by the electors then they are elected as the president. ",4,1,152

",5,2,12
0A6F7ECC5B8F,"Conclusion.The article ""The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong' ,by Bradford Plumer it quoted ,Back in 1960,segregationists in the Louisana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose Jhon F. Kennedy.(So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy).The election whould have gone the other way if the due to the electoral college. The electoral college are way too risky to take on. just simply couple of unwilling electors can change the tide of the election. ",3,2,98
0AC09FD13E72,"Conclusion.This might be the hundreth letter opened about this electoral college topic, but this is a very important subject that needs to be run by all of our citizens. Honestly the electoral college is very important because of the fact that after elections after everyone has voted they are the ones that are the electors for the President and the Vice President. Its not like it was made for no reason it was made to make the elections fair, it's not like it's the first time people have wanted to get abolish the Electoral College even many people have wanted to remove this like for example Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and more but this dosnt mean that it is the right choice. Yes it is agreed that there are some downs to have the Electoral College, plus even the person that the Electoral College votes fo that might not be the person most of the nation choose. Like now in the 2012 elections Obama had more Electoral votes than Romney""Because almost all states award the electorsl votes on a winner-takes all basis."" ",4,2,186
0AC09FD13E72,"Conclusion.Like think about it if one of the big states for example lets say Texas wants to vote for canidate but two smaller states want to vote for another canidate but they don't have enough votes to compete with that one big state then the bigger states would always wn the elections and that dosnt make the elections fair like thet should be and that just makes it worse that ""it is"" now beacuse with the electoral college it makes the voting fair because they can see the what all the states want and they can choose who is right for the poisition. People might have other opinions and that is completley fine but at the end of the day a disision has to made and it would be best if it was the best desision for the people being made. ",3,0,142

0B2C0C1833BF,Conclusion.TO volatier they have to wear old cloths. they have a seartan time for them to be done. if they are bord at home they can ask the people to do more work with the community service. the people will tell them what ever they want. then the volienters will go home or stay there ware they are at. ,3,1,60
0B30792F314D,Conclusion.In reality even though the popular vote doesn't make a difference it can persuade the representatives of the state to change their mind or it can make them realize that they are making the right decision because of how their state is chosing to vote. This should change their mind because the people elected them knowing that they will vote for who they promised to vote for and will most likely stay true to their state and to their party. ,3,0,81

0B52B1F1265B,"Concluding Statement.In my opinion, driverless cars do not need to be developed. The science and technology involved is susceptible to malfunction and could result in many problems. There is a lack of safety when it comes to these cars and various states agree. Also, a driver could be clueless and not listen to the alerts given be the car when it was trying to gain their attention. This could lead to an accident or something even worse. For these reasons, I oppose the development of driverless cars. ",1,2,88

You help them to read and they grow up to become president just because you took time out of your life to help them. ",3,0,78
0B6B5E779566,"Conclusion.but I could be troubling for some people. There has to be a lot of thought put into making this decision, from the person making the decision and their point of view on it to the people that are going to be affected once the decision is made. All this will have to be thought out taking into consideration the type of community service that is going to be required to do . ",3,1,73
0B6B5E779566,"Conclusion.Growing up helping people with small acts of kindness as simple as getting an elder person a glass of water, helping someone put in groceries, helping out serve food at a homeless shelter will make you a better person inside and out.

The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electors votes is required to elect the President.

0B8629C697D5,"Conclusion.Democrats in Texas,for example, or Repuublicans in Claiforina. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. ",3,0,39

0BAF08001514,"Conclusion.They text, go on face book, play games, some even talk on the phone. Most kids go to the bathroom to text and talk to people so I think that you should at least let people use there phones at floor. because that would probably stop most of them from texting during class if they can look forward to texting during floor and lunch time and other free times they have during school hours.

0C0C473FA794,"Conclusion.Maybe, the ""face"" is a weathered rock and when shadows cross over it it really looks like a face. Does that seem truthful enough to you? Or even believable? Sometimes when we look at clouds they can be different shapes as what we think they look like. To you, this is artifact that needs further examination. If we could excavate it from Mars we could further our studies on what truly made this rock really look like a face. How could this happen, you may ask? The cost of getting another spaceship to Mars and having a crew does cost alot of money, I understand. NASA made the last possible missions come true, would we be putting the people in that spaceship in danger? ",3,0,125
0C0C473FA794,"Conclusion.To me the artifact looks like a giant rock, with holes in it. When the shadows of clouds do come along it looks like a face. We may reallly never know who, what, or how this confusing landmark was made. The whole solar system moves around the sun, sometimes they said that they couldnt find Cydonia. Its stuck behind the cloud storms, but this face is really a natural landform on Mars. Now pictures can be photoshopped can't they? If this really was a face why does it look the way it does? From early pictures they turned out blurry and you cant really see the face. I still dont see the face. ",3,0,114
0C0E56A1FB05,Conclusion.said In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president. Another reason why we should keeep the Electoral College is that it doees the vote cast on how many people are in the state not how big the state is. ,3,0,49

0C1BFE5E9F69,"Concluding Statement.if they are going to try and make students make good grade just to play sports not all students can do as I say because making an A or B is hard for some of these students, and it will mess them up if they were hoping to go pro in some type of sport . So I don't really think that is a good idea to make it were you have to have a ""B"" average in order to play some type of sport its crazy I think so anyways. ",1,0,92
0C1D8179D5F3,"Conclusion.first of all,even though the electoral collage consists of 538 electors ",3,1,13
0C1D8179D5F3,Conclusion.due to more people and more relibilty then with 570 people. ,3,1,12
0C1D8179D5F3,"Conclusion.like al gore even though he was popular he still lost the presidency. according to bradford plumer over 60 precent of voters would perfer a direct election also,how are we sure to trust the electors anyway? is texians vote on john kerry they might not lisin and vote on whoever they want out of spite ",3,1,57
0C1D8179D5F3,"Conclusion.and they occasionally refuse to vote for the party canidate. and disaster will happen is two slates of electors to congress like when it happend in hawaii in 1960 when richard nixion only wanted elector voters but luckly he did it ""without establishing a precedent"". and what would happen if theirs a tie in the electoral vote? then the electorals would be thrown to the house of represenitives and they vote on the president there.

129427624B81,"Conclusion.Here is a prime example, in the 2000 election Al Gore won the popular vote but because he had less electoral votes than Bush he unfourtunetly lost the election. According to Bradford Plumer ""over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" It seems rather logical that if somebody gains the most votes in an election that the country would prefer that canidate to be the president. For that reason alone the reader should side with the idea to abolish the electoral college. Now besides somebody receiving more or less electoral votes, perhaps the candidates tied. In this case it gets thrown to the House Of Representitives which will cause a Wyoming Rep. with 500,000 voters to have just as much say as a California Rep. with 35,000,000 voters. All a tie would do is corrupt the voting system even more than it is. For those reasons there should be an indefinite ban on the electoral college. ",3,2,168
12C119C37C62,"Conclusion.In the article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" Bradford Plumer states, ""And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occured is a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way."" Being that there is a lesser number of votes counted in an election due to the Electoral College, there is a highly greater chance of the outcome resulting in a tie rather than showing a clear winner. If the election was based off of the most popular vote, there would be a higher number of votes for each candidate, therefore reducing the chances of ending in a tie. Secondly, in the article, ""What is the Electoral College?"" the Office of the Federal Register wrote, ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral vote is required to elect the President."" This statement shows that the Electoral College requires more than just the majority of citizen's opinions. If  at least half of the population votes one way, there should be no question about who is the winner. The most popular vote system would award the candidate that was favored by at least half of the population, therefore providing a clear and fair election. Clearly, the most popular vote sysytem would significantly benefit the American Society. ",3,2,251

Every single candidate running for President in the state that you live in has his or her own group of electors. Usually, the electors are chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what is their jobs and their responsibilities are in that spot. The presidential election is held every four years on the 2nd Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Generally, a lot, or most states have the ""winner-takes-all"" system tattooed in their minds that all electors to the winning presidential candidate.

After the presidential election, the governor of the state that you live in prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment.""

Each party selects a slate os electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. The Electoral College is widely regarded as an person or thing in the past that cannot fit in the present.

1BEB13D46E9D,"Conclusion.No voters vote a nation election, also in that order about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012's election. The popular vote was in Florida. Other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than some other small states do. Almost some of the voters are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on a average type of level, and most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election. ",3,1,81
1BEB13D46E9D,"Conclusion.Pedigree is the origin and history of something, when it is good or impressive. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that some of the large states lose by virtue of mal-apportionment of the Senate. The Electoral College avoid problems of elections in which no candidate receives majority of the votes. Sometimes it can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a type of candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.

However, most students do not share the same beliefs nowadays. They dread going to school because they have to wake up early and rush to get to school on time. They wish to wake up on their own and get the day going at their own pace. When a student has to rush to shcool against theirt will, it can increase stress and reduce productivity. This can be a huge obstacle in the path of their education. Some schools offer distance learning, which allows students to take classes at home through online or video conferencing ",4,2,124

1CD84A125450,"Conclusion.The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: on for each member in the House of Representitaves plus two for your Senators. The District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. Everyone in the political group votes. That means if you already did'nt ruin your reputation you have a chance at becoming the president because, everyone on at one point and time in the political party is equal. It also make sure everyon is heard, it makes everyone useful for something. The Electoral College gives everybody a chance which is probably the best detail about the system. ",3,1,134

I think that the principal should make it a B average to stay in sports because she should know some people really work hard to get were they are today.

243ED18B29C0,"Conclusion.. It may be because they are not very good test takers or their study habits are very poor. Some might not be able to concentrate and they get distracted very easily. It would be unfair for these students because of their inability to maintain the B average. The school would be responsible for not letting these kids participate in sports and other activities; therefore, in order to give them a better chance at getting the B average, the school should provide tutoring and extra help sessions for the kids who really need the help. The teachers could give them verbal quizzes on what they are learning if they are not very good test takers. They could give them homework that they might better understand and also provide them with extra credit opportunites. The sports teams may despretley need a kid that is very athletic, but not very smart and if this policy were to go into effect, then the school must provide the additional help. ",3,2,166

He asked for the answers to the questions on the test and while he was busy typing it out little did he know that the teacher was watching him the whole time. The teacher had to stop everybody that was taking the test and had to figure out who was cheating. After that his phone was token away from him and was in major trouble. Not only was it not worth it to get in trouble for this but it distracted the whole class and academically took away from everybody's experience. Yet another time that someone got in trouble was when my friend decided to send explicit text messages to his girlfriend. Now if that wasn't bad enough he did it during class, when everybody was watching. Now he didn't caught on his end but when the girlfriend received the message someone heard it and said something. The teacher then confiscated the phone and found the messages. She looked at who sent it and reported it to the office. Both people involved were sent to the office and were in major trouble involving parents and everything. This type of behavior would not be uncommon if the cell phone policy was instituted. ",3,2,234

Without the challenge of competing peers and uncomfortable situations for students the techniques would be less effective. To begin there is evidence to support that students in unfamiliar habitats like a school test better than students that are familiar with their testing environment. So students learning from home would test worse than students at school just due to the simple fact that they are more relaxed in their environment.

But if a person did put there face inprint on a another planet, I think they will turn into a alien. I will tell you why I said that, because people say that aliens are real and they harm creatures. Also, if I'm the scientist this will tells that a FACE on a human body doing on a another planet they should be on earth. ",3,1,89
2751851F289B,"Conclusion.Also, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face, an enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on the monitors. But now scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa common enough around Cydonia only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. ",3,1,91
2751851F289B,"Conclusion.But if I'm the scientist trying to figured out all this work,and see who's the human face or a alien face because humans on earth an aliens in Mars or more planets. But afterwards after that happening, it saids how some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars. Also, although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact photographing Cydonia became a prioprity for NASA when Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September. 1997, eighteen long years ago after the Viking missions ended.

283F30E12B90,Conclusion.i strongly believe that we should have Electoral vote. ,5,0,10
283F30E12B90,"Conclusion.With the Electoral College, it all depnds on if you state agrees to have a certain person as president. As informed in ""What is the Electoral College?"" it states that "" The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. This makes it a majority vote i order for you state to win for which ever candianate. ",3,1,69
283F30E12B90,"Conclusion.During the 2012 election with Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, Romney had to win Ohio and Florida's Electoral vote. But becasue Obama won Florida he remained in office as our president. With this Electoral vote its a amke or break. Its not always the best thing but its the right thing. With the Electoral College you vote for a slate of voters who then vote for president. As Richard A. Posner informed us, "" Its entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular vote than Bush yet fewer electoral votes."" ",3,0,115

294099CEB05C,"Concluding Statement.Having the students maintain an grade B average at our school is a policy that should be passed.

Helping the students think for themselves, giving them necessary elements in life, and keeping them well rounded; this is what the policy offers. I think that the policy should be passed. It helps kids grow to be better adults, as well as help them in other situations in life. By doing the policy, it enhancing our generation, as well as many to come. Instead of more and more kids just barely making the grades, they will work towards being the best student they could be. The teachers are happy, the students feel proud of their grades, and all the activities are filled with smart wonderful children, this is why the policy you are suggesting should be passed and should be started in our school.

294CA62F98EC,"Conclusion.Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.""(source 2) which means that they won't visit every state because there is no reason to visit some.

294CA62F98EC,"Conclusion.Some people do say The electoral vote is for the better. "" The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President. ",2,0,32
29534C6BD280,Conclusion.I think the election system should change to most popular state votes ,5,0,13
29534C6BD280,"Conclusion.In 1960, the Louisiana legislature nearly replaced the Democratic electors with new electors so John F. Kennedy wouldn't get the most popular vote, while that was going on electors were being defiant about voting for their party's candidate and voted for whoever they wanted to choose. also in 1960, a state sent two slates of electors to congress in Hawaii, but Vice President Richard Nixon validated his opponent's eclectors without establishing a precedent. ",3,0,74
29534C6BD280,"Conclusion.If the state uses a different system such as counting votes from different states, we wouldn't have as much problems we have with it now because the votes in the electoral college are outdated and irrational, ",0,2,37
29534C6BD280,"Concluding Statement.So the reason why we should retain the electoral college sytem because it's not fair because they avoid the run off elections which happened in 1968 and 1992 to Nixon and Clinton but the electoral college reduced the electoral votes in the run off elections, the electoral college never thinks about the outcome and almost have the winning president lose, in 2012 Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote and had the same percentage of popular votes than Romney, and the electoral college turn off potential voters for a candidate knowing their votes will have no effect because they don't pay attention to the campaign. ",1,0,109
296D2E892341,"Conclusion.If aliens were real than I would believe it. Than again in the passage it also says that The ""face"" could be a mesa. Whenever they took a picture of it ten times sharper than the one before people still wouldn't believe that it is a rock and not an alien creation. When they say alien creation they think of an alien standing there and cutting into rock to make it look like a human face with a really big head.

299C0AA4D716,"Conclusion.The electoral college has many inherint flaws that make it less desirable than a simple election by popular vote. It's only rebuttals to said flaws are weak, and provide little to no reason why the college is beneficial. So there is no real reason to have it in the first place. ",4,2,52

299C0AA4D716,Conclusion.Though why does it even matter if the candidate you want to vote for won't even come to your state? There's obviously no reason to vote democrat if your say will simply be overshadowed by the wave of republicans in your area. ,0,2,43
299C0AA4D716,"Conclusion.With popular vote though, candidates should be more inclined to visit as many states as possible and get their message out there. Because a 51% vote in a state no longer means a 100% victory. With the new influx of political campaigns, perhaps more people are swayed from their usual path of voting. While yes, there are neutral states that need a push either way, you're not going to increase your votes ten-fold by pushing past that 50% barrier. You actually have to earn every vote you get.

29BE895CD900,Conclusion.The bad thing about Electoral Colleges is if there a run-off election ,0,1,13
2A2F04CC199E,"Conclusion.Lastly, community service is important because it gets people off their couch and in to the streets helping people. ",0,2,20

My friend sometimes has to leave school early just to go to her job and works eight hour shifts, five days a week and stays up to do her homework or sometimes isn't able to complete it. Online school or video conferencing would save drastic amounts of time in order for her to be able to work more to provide for her family and be able to pay for online school and make meals for her family, while still getting her education. Overall, online school would be a better option for some students whose family situations may need a little more attention than others ",3,2,154

2B1C42B1F534,"Conclusion.Richard Nixon, Jimmy carter, Bob Dole, and plenty of oothers think that it should change because according to a gallup poll in 2000 taken shortlyafer Al Gore he wonn the popular vote but lost the presidency dur to the quirks of the electoral college. in the Electoral College system people vote not for the prresident but for a slate of electors as i had said in the last pargrraph who in turn elect or the president. electors could be anyon not holding public office. voters sometimes control who there electors vote for. wich makes the voters sometimes get confsed about the electors wich makes them vote for the wrong candidate. In the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in the centery. in 1960 segegaters in Louisiana legslater nearly suceeddin replacing Democratic electora with new electors. So that the popular vote for Kennedy woulld not have actually gone to Kennedy.

2B557F0EF764,Conclusion.In education we always have a choice to choose rather we get our education at home or through public and private school but which one is the right choice ? Throughout this essay we will explore the pros and cons on which one is the more beneficial choice. Many kids in life go to public schools since the start of their education life but there are those that choose to get education at home. A child's personality also adds on to what the better choice might be for that certain individual. There are a lot of benefits and non-benefits to having a student attend classes from home. ,4,2,107
2B557F0EF764,Conclusion.prevent a student from learning valuable lessons in life ,0,2,10
2B557F0EF764,Conclusion.People will argue that some benefits of attending classes from home is better by stating that it prevents students from being bullied and gives students a better environment. ,2,2,29
2B557F0EF764,"Conclusion.A good environment is always wanted for a child who is getting their education but an environment at home even though it looks beneficial may not always be the case. Having a student attend classes at home takes their chances of learning social skills that are gained through public schools and interactions. Through classes in schools students learn to work with others and gain skills that will help in the future with co-workers and everyday life. Classes at home make an oppressive environment where a student doesn't gain these skills which in the end will effect how well they can interact with others in society. In the end, attending classes in school is much better than online because of how it helps with bullying and teaches student important social skills. ",3,2,131
2B557F0EF764,"Concluding Statement.Students will face many hardships in life but through going to school and attending classes in school they will learn valuable lessons and learn about themselves. A student will face being unmotivated but with help support from peers and teachers they will get through those times. Online classes are not beneficial to a student because it prevents them from gaining social skills and makes it harder from them to go out in the world. Even though, it may seem like online classes will prevent bullying and be a better environment that is not the case. It will hurt the student more by them not knowing what to do in cases of being bullied and also keeping them in an oppressive environment away from others. Classes in school help shape a students identity, helps them learn about themselves, and the world. In conclusion, attending classes from home is not more beneficial because of the lack of motivation, lack of support, and how it doesn't help shape a students identity. What do you think is more beneficial for a student online classes or classes in school?          ",1,2,186

2B568E2031B1,"Conclusion.A couple examples to do outside would be to pick up trash or tutor someone. If you pick up trash, people might notice and they will stop throwing stuff out of there car window. They also might help pick up trash. If you help someone else they other person will benefit with a better education, that will be needed for a good job later in life, or the kids might be nice to other people since you were nice to them!

2B568E2031B1,"Conclusion.If you do sports or something in that category then you could be recognized at the end of the season for volunteering outside of school.

You can send out letters to their parents to help get them involved too and make it family related. Also placing more recycling bens rather than trash cans around the school would be great too. A few posters and handouts might also get the idea into their young minds. Emails, billboards, or signs on trucks would also help. ",3,0,105

2C8521890B5A,"Conclusion.Presient Richard Nixon, and President Bill Clinton both have something in common; they won their presidencies with the Electoral College, not the popular vote.

2C8521890B5A,"Conclusion.Look at ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" Mitt Romney doesn't campaign in the South part of the United States since he knows that he is popular in that region with the electors he doesn't bother camapigning there since he knows he will win their votes. But he has to campaign to other states and regions since he knows the South doesn't have enough power to make him president. And with that comes your swing states and the big states. Swing states listen to what the presidental candidates have to say since they are toss-up states. These swing states literally can ""swing"" the election. These are the states that are going to decide who the next president is. And that ties in with your big states; California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania are some of your big states since they have the most population out of the United States. These states can also be swing states since they have the most votes out of every state. With the power of the popular vote a presidental canidate can become president, and other regions will not have a say. But using the Electoral College that can't happen. ",3,2,208

This source is arguing against the Electoral college, meaning they're trying to make a point on why it's not fair that Obama won with his 61.7 percent. The people vote for their electoral college, for their state. If the electoral college's votes are higher than the popular votes that means that the college is doing their job correctly. Source 3 also states, ""... Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral- vote victory in that state."" This statement means that even if the popular and electoral votes are both high, the electoral vote wins, because majority rules. Just because the person running for office is popular, doesnt mean they should necessarily win. Electoral votes basically come from the people, and if the ""people"" choose a certain candidate, then that's who should win.

You must stay focused on the road and have both hands on the wheel, so you could very easliy just drive the car yourself without the worry. This way you can control the situations that you get into, and not having a car get you into trouble that you might not be able to get out of.

This method of campaigning in the swing states doesn't allow for much campaining in the big, numerous votes states. An example of this would be that during the 2000 campaign, almost 20 states did not see the candidates at all as well as campaign ads. With the Electoral College system in place, Presidential candidates are focusing more on obatianing the ""swing state"" votes and not so much on supporting and visiting the states and people they know they have.

If cell phones were allowed, rumors would fly around the school. In a matter of minutes, everyone would know the latest gossip, just by one person pressing the ""Send to all"" button. This can lead to bullying, which could also lead to a flaw in that student's education. So no matter what, cell phones are a disadvantage to a school. ",3,2,82

3493BED78E8E,"Conclusion.The Electoral College system has a ""winner-take-all"" system. Which means if a Democrat candidate wins they will have Democrat electors and if a Republican wins the will have Republican electors. In source one the Office of the Federal Register also said that the ""winner-take-all"" system ""awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"". This is not fair to the voters or the United States. If a tie happened it would be even more unfair to voters. if a tie did happen the House of Representatives would break it. In source two Plumer said ""the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. If the voting doesnt even show your will why vote? Plumer also said in source two that ""the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational"". I agree with plumer, the Electaral College needs to go. ",3,0,143
3493BED78E8E,"Concluding Statement.We should abolish the Electoral College and change the election to popular vote for the president of the United States. Popular voting is alot better for everyone. The pros of popular voting excedes the pros of the Electoral College. Popular voting gives everyone a fair chance and doesnt just have a ""winner-take-all"" system. it actually gives both political parties a chance.

Also the electoral college is unfair to voters. It is unfair becuase of the winner-take-all system in each state. Candidates dont go to states they know there not going to win in.

3544D0B1BCDB,"Conclusion.In my opinion, this change is immensely unfair to the student body, will cause disarray among the different clubs, and will hurt the school much more than it will aid the school. My understanding is that you are considering this policy change so that students will work harder to retain a B average and so the student body will improve, however, you must also consider the numerous possible negative consequences. ",5,2,71
3544D0B1BCDB,"Conclusion.First however, I believe some background knowledge is required. As you know already, a C grade average is considered average in most of our country, where as a B or an A average are considered above average, and outstanding, respectively. Also, as you may know already, most of the student body retains a C average. Your change in school policy would mean that everybody who is currently participating in school activities would be kicked out of them until new term grades come in at which point they may only hope that they did well enough to continue their sport. Our competitive would all fail do to the almost complete rooting of the students. Now this may only last a term, but who knows how long it might take to raise your grade average by a whole letter? You obviously went to school when you were a child, and I assume you enjoyed the extra curricular clubs which your school had to offer. Now imagine this. Imagine that you learned that you had to maintain an A or B average to continue in these sports. Now this was one of the years where you didn't do so well, and therefore got a C average. Wouldn't such a thing be detrimental to you? It would cause you to be kicked out of every activity which you participated in unless you managed to raise your grade! That is one the main points I am putting forth. ",3,2,244
3544D0B1BCDB,Conclusion.A person who might spend a huge amount of time practicing their sport but who was not the best academic wise would find themselves in an incredibly bad spot. They would not be allowed to participate in the sport which they loved until they academically improved. ,3,0,47
3544D0B1BCDB,"Conclusion.Students would easily find themselves in depression when they are unable to retain the correct grade average and such a thing would never be good for a school. Also people would have to deal with the stress of knowing that if they do not do well enough in school, they will not be able to participate in the things which they love. Such a thing is almost the same as bribing students to do well in school. Because they do well enough they're allowed to play a sport or join a club but if they don't they cannot do anything extra-curricular. ",3,2,102
3544D0B1BCDB,"Conclusion.this would thoroughly disorganise after-school help due to the fact that after-school help falls under the category an ""other activity."" Students who needed help would not be able to get it through conventional methods within school. ",0,2,38
3544D0B1BCDB,"Concluding Statement.Certainly you cannot think that such a change would be a good thing for the school! All it would bring is chaos and stress and the amount of people who improve would also find themselves always under pressure, always struggling to be above average. There are various things that could go wrong under such a monumental change. It would certainly be unfair to the students, the activities would be very disorganized (some of them might even be forced to close due to lack of participants), and it would be unhealthy for all your students.

For example, group projects do more for the individual than teach them a bunch of facts and figures. They also simulate the level of collaboration students will use regularly as future members of the workforce. Similarly, assigning nightly homework goes deeper than the teacher's desire to keep their pupils busy, as learning to balance piles of graded assignments is an effective way to teach lessons about time management. Taking online classes will enact these same skills to an extent, though the lack of classmates combined with a more flexible schedule puts students in a bit of a bubble.

The reasons I would like to see the Electoral college do good is because the first reason as to why you should just keep the Electoral college is because everyone will want to be president heres an example .The Electoral college requires a presidential canidate to have transregional appeal.

3A3AD368D10E,"Conclusion.Our country is changing day by day, and we certainly have made monumental changes since the Electoral College came to be. According to Bradford Plumer, author of, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" a poll was taken by Gallup in the year 2000 that showed that less than just forty percent of Americans support the election system that we have now. This proves that it is time for a change and that the system that we currently have in place has been in place for far too long. The everchanging United States of America is in desperate need of an up-to-date election system that fits the current needs of the American people. The Electoral College is not only outdated, but it is also an extremely complex voting method. In an article entitled, ""What Is the Electoral College,"" written by the Office of the Federal Register, it is explained that the Electoral College is a lengthy process that involves the choosing of electors and the issuing of Certificates of Ascertainment after both the people and the electors have voted. The Electoral College does far more harm than good for our country and for this reason especially, I believe that America should begin to elect its Presidents using the popular voting method.

3A3AD368D10E,"Conclusion.In his article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" Bradford Plumer specifically states that the people themselves do not vote for their desired candidate, but instead, they vote for electors who then vote for the more popular presidential candidate. The people should be the ones who vote for the president because they will be the ones who are governed by the president. The Electoral College gives no voice to the people and is considered by many to be a non-democratic way of voting and is often referred to anachronism. Today, it is a struggle to encourage people to vote and be present on election day because no one feels like their vote matters. People say that one vote doesn't make a difference and that there is no point in filling out a ballot if it has no real affect on which candidate is chosen. The Electoral College and the process it established is really just confirming these opinions. People do not feel like they are contributing because when it comes down to it, the electoral votes are the deciding votes. The Electoral College only has a little over five hundred electors that are representing the millions of regular people who show up at the polls on election day. In order to make the people feel like their opinions are being voiced and their voice is being heard, and to increase voter turnout on election day, it is imperative that the country switches over to election by popular vote. 
",3,2,258
3A3AD368D10E,"Concluding Statement.In summation, the Electoral College has been around for hundreds of years, but it is time that the United States makes the change that would improve the way of electing its future Presidents. The Electoral College is outdated and complicated, does not allow the voice of the people to be heard, and leads to uneccessary voting complications. For these reasons, I vehemently feel that we should switch from the Electoral College to election by popular vote.         ",1,2,78
3A40B235E0C4,"Conclusion.Beacause the founding fathers etablished it in the

Constitution as a compromise between election of the

President by a vote in

Congress and elction of the

President by a poular of qualified citizens. We would not want to change the

Constitution that are great founding fathers had once made before ",0,0,51
3A40B235E0C4,Conclusion.The american people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election in the century the system allows for much worse. ,3,0,25
3A40B235E0C4,Conclusion.Prehaps most worrying is the prospect of the election vote would be tied in the elctorlal vote. In that case the election would thown to the house of represenitives where state delegation vote on the president ,3,1,37
3AD47B68A985,"Conclusion.A popular vote should instead be utilized to fairly choose the people of power in this country and would better represent voters' opinions. 
",5,2,24
3AD47B68A985,Conclusion.This may not seem like much of a problem ,2,2,10
3AD47B68A985,"Conclusion.but consider this: a swing state such as Florida with over 20 electoral votes could go to a candidate who could have won by a 51 to 49 percent margin. This means that all the voters who voted for the other candidate no longer count, making the electoral college ineffective at voicing the opinions of the populous. ",6,2,58
3AD47B68A985,"Conclusion.In the Electoral College, ""voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"" (Bradford 10). These electors may not necessarily vote for what candidate voters want most as president, and could do what they might feel is the best decision; however, this is not always what the majority of voters want in a president and could end up with a poor president. In addition, most voters know very little about how these electors are chosen and are not in control of who their state's electors are. In a way this system is a bit corrupt, because the voters don't have the final say of the president. ",3,2,116
3ADF2D3323BE,"Conclusion.Also, you'll get caught and your phone will be taken away. When you start having free time or lunch period, then its alright for you to use your phone because nobody is teaching you. My opinion is that its better off if we can use our phones while having lunch or break time, so nobody can tell you to put your phone away or take it away from you because its our time to do whatever we want to do.

3B5EE97C7C53,"Conclusion.The United States, as well as other parts of the world, experience oil and fuel issues. There are frequent shortages of these particular substances, which are extrememly important for our daily lives. In the article, it is said, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world."" In this quote, from the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" Google cofounder Sergey Brin expresses that these driverless cars will be beneficial to America and the rest of the world ",3,2,100
3B5EE97C7C53,"Conclusion.He says that these cars will use less fuel, which unfortunately tends to run short. Driverless cars will benefit the the world's fuel issues. ",0,2,25
3B5EE97C7C53,Conclusion.Another positive to driverless cars are the entertainment and noficiation aspects. Drivers will be able to get different things done while driving. ,0,2,23
3B5EE97C7C53,"Conclusion.However, these driverless cars still do obtain some faults. These faults are included in the article. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" This shows that drivers must retain some sort of awareness of what is going on around them. They cannot take naps or completely zone out, especially when approaching an accident or work zone. ",2,2,100
3B5EE97C7C53,"Conclusion.Although there are few flaws to the designs of driverless cars, these flaws should be fixed very soon. The article states, ""Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved. Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. The road to the truly autonomous car stretches on ahead of us, but we grow closer to the destination every day."" This quote shows that many of these issues should be resolved in the very near future.

3B93FA6833FA,"Conclusion.The B average,

I think is a little to high for some of my peers. ",0,0,16
3B93FA6833FA,"Conclusion.I also oppose this policy because the students who wish to be a sports star must have good grades in College, but if they get below a B average in elementary, middle, or high school, then so what? the students try to juggle social and academics and if your grade skips a little bit, then they can't be on their team.

3BD1B5A4F714,Concluding Statement.Community service isn't a very good thing to make students perform at an early age. It takes away time and opportunities and gives too much responsibility to students. Students should be able to enjoy their childhood and not remember it as cleaning up litter. ,1,2,46
3C1F9041C565,Conclusion.Should our way of voting in the United States be changed? The way we vote today is through the electoral college. Each president get a certain number of electoral votes and that is how we vote on specific leaders. The Electoral College process was established in our Constitution as a compromise. This way we could elect our president by a vote in Congress and election of our president by citizens who qualify. ,4,0,73
3C1F9041C565,"Conclusion.Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, adn the AFL-CIO all agreed on abolishing it. It is proven that 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Most voters today are significantly uninformed. Some do not even know what or whom they are voting for. Some of these people are not even U.S. citizens. Yes, some states do require to so identification, although others do not. A direct election would be more specified and easier for people to choose and use. Some people overlook these detail while others enjoy the system because of the power it provides them. There are multiple errors in the voting process. There are certain people that do not even posess a high school degree, let alone a college degree, that vote just because they want to. The is a massive suply of ignorance and pride that fall into play with the Electoral College. ",3,0,162

3C5CFABBA1F0,Conclusion.and it makes presidents focus on states disproportionally ,6,0,9
3C5CFABBA1F0,"Conclusion.Due to the Electoral College relying on a majority rules system, the vote of a single person can be completely insignificant. ",0,2,22
3C5CFABBA1F0,"Conclusion.To put this into perspective, here's an example of why supporting big swing states should not be rewarded. The US has 6 states. 5 are completely democrats and each have populations of 20. 1 is half democrat half republican and has a population of 100(assume 20 people equals an electoral vote). If the republican presidential candidate convinces a single democrat in the big state to vote for them, they will get the majority vote in that state and get 5 electoral votes. This results in the democratic presidential candidate, with 149 people supporting him, tying with the republican presidential candidate, with 51 people supporting him. Simple logic shows that the opinion of 149 people is more important than that of 51 people, so a popular vote system would have been best in this situation. ",3,2,135
3C5CFABBA1F0,"Conclusion.The focus on certain states is such a popular method by the presidential candidates, that, according to source 2, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all...""Big states and swing states should not receive much more attention per citizen from the presidential candidates than little states do.

3CA61DE9B5C6,"Conclusion.Cell phones today are generally used for many reasons. They may be used for texting, calling, emergencies, and many more reasons. Shocking but true, in this day in time, people need cell phones. Some may be against this matter, but do they know everything besides teens texting everywhere they go? Cell phones are one of the major ways of communicating. ",4,2,61
3CA61DE9B5C6,"Conclusion.Eight out of ten schools who allowed students to have their phone out at a specific time of day saw a decrease in the number of phones out during class time. Giving students this time will show that you trust them to do what they are supposed to in class. Plus, students may realize administrators trust them to keep their phones off and in their pockets during class. ",3,2,69
3CBB0AD46687,Conclusion.the electoral college system also has many things wrong with it besides being unfair. ,0,0,15
3CBB0AD46687,Conclusion.When you vote for the President you should be directly voting for him or her not voting for an electoral slate. Candidates should try to win the vote of everyone no matter what not heavily campaign in some states and rarely campaign in others. ,3,0,45

3D99FC2386BD,Conclusion.that people can still steer and accelerte and slow down with just sensors and you can use half of the fuel and aloowing better response aand reduce power from the engine and the sensors make the car safer to drive . but it may not be safe to drive computer driven cars because of malfinction and that can be dangerous and they have to wait to make sure that is is reliably safe to drive it may not be as easy as they make it seem. sometimes the driver has to take over to pull in and out out of driveways to be on the safe side but the driverless car runs on electrical cables wich may not be safe that runs through radio signals to the front of the car. This may be alot of work to just drive a car beacsue of smarter roads and they need a whole lot of sensors on the car but they are still waiting on the law. ,3,1,165
3DBAD6F954EB,"Conclusion.I stand with the makeing of these cars and the possiblities that come with in our society. The cars would be able to open new doors to health benefits, lowering crash ratios, and much more. The driverless car would be a great achievement in human curisosity and invention. These cars would better many different levels of society if made and used propely. ",5,2,63

I personally think that community service is a volunteer job and that people of the community should do it at their own free will.

3EFA3EE80C51,Conclusion.I think its up to the youth of today to keep our communities in good shape. ,0,0,17
3EFA3EE80C51,Conclusion.Requiring students to do community service would get things done faster and more efficiently rather than asking them to do it on their own time. ,0,0,26
3EFA3EE80C51,"Conclusion.For example, if you ask a random student, ""Would you like to help me pick up trash?"" they are most likely to say they have something better to do. If they were told they have to, it would get done and if you added something that is entertaining to that person they are more likely to come back and help again. ",3,0,63

It affectall of us people get cheated and scandaled out of money from politics all the time this one way that they do it ,3,1,69
3F1A4C0C773A,Concluding Statement.The electoral college is definatly something to argue about but in my opinion it should be kept.

441A5D13BCF3,"Conclusion.The number of electors in the Electoral College consits of 538 electors in total, which makes a tie completley possible, although it has never happened, in the past only a few more votes were required to create this unlikley problem ",0,2,41
441A5D13BCF3,"Conclusion.According to source 3, paragraph 18, Richard A. Posner claims that, ""A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number, but it is highly unlikley..."" There's a shockingly short ammount of votes required to turn an election into a situtation where both canidates have an even number of votes, a problem almost occured in 1976, that were if, according to source #2, paragraph #12, Bradford Plumer, ""a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way."" Those may look as if they are big numbers, however in comparison to the amount of voters in each state, these are not large amounts of people who needed to vote the other way. In comparison, the number of representatives is determined by the number of members in your congressional delegation, the amount of electors per state is fair. Still, however, the event of a tie would cause a lot of issues within our country, and would be relieved if the winner was elected by popular vote. 
",3,2,183
441A5D13BCF3,"Conclusion.The other factor tying in is that the voters feel as if their direct vote does not count. While it is true one vote cannot sway the election, it becomes apparent that canidates must have transregional appeal, meaning that they're favored in that region of the U.S. ",0,2,49
441A5D13BCF3,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion, the Electoral College seems unconstitutional, since a variety of issues can occur due to the many problems that could potentially occur. The United States should shift into a more reasonable and logical means of electing our president in our Republic, where everybody is equal. The Electoral College should no longer decide the president based on the possibility of a tie, the possibility for betrayal of trust and disputes due to how close the votes are. The system should change to where the popular opinion should  decide on the president of the United States of America, making people believe that their vote will be fairly counted. ",1,2,109

446CB94BD577,"Conclusion.This is why Wyoming has only three votes and Florida has twenty nine. It's nothing to complain about, because it's the same number of people each state has in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, meaning each state has at least three votes, decided by its population. This is not a very bad system because the states with huge populations have a bit of their power curbed by the number of electors. So if Wyoming increases its population, and Florida has its population decreased, one of the electors could be removed from Florida and added to Wyoming, balancing the scale of power between them. It's only fair for a populous state like Florida to have more electors anyway, there are many opinions that are yearning to be heard within the ginormous population, and there must be enough electors who can take it upon themselves to voice them. The Electoral College protects us from the probability of voting just because the candidate is from the same state. A majority of people will vote because of a close association with a candidate if the electoral college is abolished. This is why the electoral college only contains 538 people, because nobody wants millions of voters in California voting for the same candidate just because they are the Governor of California. ",3,2,220
446CB94BD577,"Concluding Statement.The Electoral College has been there from the beginning, and the without it the United States of America could be thrown into chaos. Traditions shouldn't be broken and the Electoral College represents the biggest one of them all, it balances power between each of the states, defines a true winner, and guides the U.S. on a set timeline. It wouldn't be a far stretch to say that the Electoral College helps keep the order of the country. Truthfully, everyone needs some semblance of order, and the Electoral College provides that and more.    ",1,2,95

451E43CF8A30,"Conclusion.The Electoral Collage process consists of the selection of the electors. Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors. Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors.

Most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards the electors to the winning presidential candidate. After the persidential election, your governor prepares a ""

Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. Your state certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as a part of the official records of the presidential election.

The Electorial Collage restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. They avoid the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the casts.    ",3,1,159

",3,2,57
4631AFEED2F7,"Conclusion.For example provide a prize for the students that do more community service, that will have students provide more community service then they use to.

In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The senate would choose the vice-president.)

4F6084AE3A42,"Conclusion.The states that are larger such as Texas and california have a much larger population so the votes would be larger but the electoral college balances out and the smaller states such as new jersey and main have a small population so the votes wold be smaller.

4FE5B872FE61,"Conclusion.To demonstrate this, for power to reach a house from a faraway power plant, much more electricity is generated than needed as to make sure it can travel the long distance in cables without losing so much charge that the current becomes weak and useless, and a logical fix for such a problem would be to simply figure out a way to move the power source closer as to achieve higher efficencies. This same logic applies to cars in traffic, which use a lot of fuel to do essentially nothing. When I saw in the article ""Driveless Cars Are Coming"" that Google cofound Sergey Brin--who must be very intelligent as he IS the cofounder of Google, a very widely known and used company--said that these cars would use half the fuel of today's taxis AND offer far more flexibility than a bus, my only logical reaction was that this is a wonderful technology. ",3,2,154
4FE5B872FE61,"Conclusion.My first piece of evidence for this is that driverless cars are machines, and despite having a notoriously bad reputation for failing at times due to some error during the design process, machines do not tire and do not grumble about watching their surroundings; they also need not be perfect, only better than a person to become favorable as a driver. My second piece of evidence comes from, once again, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" when it was stated that ""enetertainment and information systems that use heads up displays [...] can be turne doff instantly when the driver needs to take over [in the case that the car senses that its own computing devices are not enough to handle a situation]"". This system appealed to me a lot due to how intuitive it is; if a person shouldn't be using something, it turns off, no questions asked. All of these factors further lead me to believe that cars are ""the way of the future"". ",3,2,165
4FE5B872FE61,"Conclusion.hacking is commonly a misunderstood phenonenon. The aboslute requirement for all hacking is access to the device that someone wishes to hack usually through some internet connection on the device linked to other functions.

51464A01F6FC,"Conclusion.In ""Source 3: In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"", author Richard A. Posner explains that the Electoral College ""restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution."" The Electoral College gives larger states more attention from presidential candidates as opposed to a smaller state. Posner continues the idea with ""the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election."" To break it down, voters who pay close attention to the campaign will be the most thoughtful voters and they will recieve the most attention from the candidates. This reduces the amount of disputes because the presidential candidates will decide on who to give the most attention to. ",3,2,139
51464A01F6FC,"Conclusion.In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"", author Richard A. Posner states that ""knowing [the voters'] vote has no effect [gives them] less incentitive to pay attention to the campaign."" But, ""voters in presidential electons are people who want to express  political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide and election."" This means thatchanging everyone to a single vote will have no effect, too because people will not put thought into who to vote, but they will just vote for whoever. ",3,2,99
515CEA13AEE5,Conclusion.i think that why would you have the electoral college when you can just vote some other way insted of having this big thing just to elect the presidant and the vice presidant why can't you just have a regular meeting deciding if you are voting for that presidant and the vice presidant the electoral college to me makes no sense why would you have this big thing that makes no sense at all ,5,0,75

As you see the evidence is how you turn on the T.V at night and see what is going on with the vote and election. For example Afganiscan, they are destroying there country becuase of how much they dislike our president, because of a unfair vote. ",3,1,103

520545C18283,Conclusion.The electoral college was established into the Constitution by our founding fathers as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of citizens. The electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Wherever you live your states allotment of electors is equal to the number of members in its Congressional delegation. ,3,1,75
520545C18283,"Concluding Statement.I think that it is the popularity vote that should decide who gets the most amount of votes and decides who become the next President of the United States. I think that the Electoral college is unfair to the citzens around the U.S.

525E2FD50DBF,"Conclusion.In article three where it says ""Everyone's President"" the author states that ""No region (South,Northeast, etc.) has enough electrol votes to elect a president."" This mean that most of the states in the south do not get the chance to vote for a presiden and this increases Romney chances of wining, and what if the candidate that wins with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president? The citizens of the United States will feel as if they aren't apart of this country, not giving the rights or freedom this country promised them. The citizens will feel like their votes do not count, when they have there opinion on something the new president will have no interest towards it, this means to us that he isn't really a president. In article last paragragh the author states ""people who think that a single vote may decide an elcetion.""In the past plenty of ties had happened before they handled this by the election would be thrown to the House of Representative.

52D49831B279,"Conclusion.Some students have low immune systems, and are sick often throughout the entire school year. Because of the fact that we would fall behind, many students will go to school no matter how sick, in order to attend class and keep their grades up. This leads to overall low performance, and low sanitation, as germs from the sick students will be on everything that they touch. Those who do stay home however, have to go back to school and make up every missed assignment, test, quiz, and homework for each class that they miss. Some schools have eight periods in a day, meaning that the student would fall behind in all of their classes. Make up work takes a lot of time and piles up quicker than many think, and staying on top of old and new subjects can overwhelm some ",3,2,142

52D49831B279,"Concluding Statement.Distance learning is one of the best tools that could be used for those who need it. Life is full of bumps and turns that some do not always expect. These bumps and turns can take students out of the classroom and cause them to fall behind their peers. Stress and loss of the drive to learn are linked, and can be seen in any classroom no matter where. Throughout the years, technology has grown and evolved. Instead of complaining about the evolution of technology, teachers and parents should be able to embrace it, and the tools that it brings students. Distance learning has many more benefits than downsides and downfalls. More schools should implement it, to adjust and accommodate to the students' needs, instead of the students having to adjust their needs for the school system. ",1,2,139

On the other hand, students who have to work in order to support their families benefit more from online learning. Students who only need a few credits to graduate or would like to be able to take non-required courses during school would benefit as well.

54A8F5B2420A,"Conclusion.An example of an essential life skill would be communication. If a student is always talking to a professor from their home, they begin to lose their social skills needed to effectively communicate with new and ordinary people outside of home. This can cause awkward, short, and even meaningless conversations in the real world. Stemming from this, finding and making new friends becomes an issue that may take a long time to resolve. Workplace skills are also extremely important skills one can lack when attending classes from home. An educational institution progressively trains students with these skills, for they are necessary in order to succeed in performing well or getting a job. Having situations where these abilities are useful are mainly in the form of doing certain assignments with or without others, listening, maintaining eye contact, and being on time. Looking back, online schooling strips one of the ability to develop skills used in the real world. ",3,2,158
54A8F5B2420A,"Conclusion.The idea of looking at a screen for hours on end is a concept that many schools tend to walk away from because it is not good for your eyes. While looking at a screen can be engaging, it is true that it causes major damage to one's eyes, especially if one were to look at a screen in the dark or when they first wake up. After long days of school at home, your eyes can start to irritate and become red, meaning the body may want a break. Online school, however, doesn't give the eyes the rest they need to function at maximum capacity, causing health problems in the long run. The technology needed for online conferencing can also ruin a student's ability to sleep well. Technology can be addicting and can keep students awake for long periods of time without rest. If students are attending online school for a few hours a day, use their phone for another few hours, and potentially engage in any other screen, they can lose sleep. Getting enough sleep for normal schooling is already a problem, so online school may not have the ability to fix that problem. The home is a comfort zone for everybody, but it can lead to a strict mental mindset. It doesn't allow people to grow to their fullest potential because they're at home most of the day, isolated from the rest of the world. One only grows by way of leaving your comfort zone, trying out new things, and going to other places. The mindset it can create can be a problem when moving on to other potentially important parts of life. The physical and mental association this type of schooling can have on a student can be devastating, to say the least. ",3,2,298
54A8F5B2420A,"Conclusion.While schools have students pledge to an honor code, cheating is inevitable in almost very student to step foot in high school. Without the physical supervision of a teacher, cheating can become a staple in one's everyday school life, if it hasn't already. A student can potentially use an online source, secret notes, or another person in the room to help them with their assignments. Cheating is essentially a form of lying as well, which is a reason why it shouldn't be done. A second bad habit that could develop would be procrastination. Procrastination is already seen often with students who go to a regular educational institution, so online education would make matters even worse. Having potentially flexible time frames can cause students to want to postpone doing their work for another time. This can eventually add up to a student having an enormous debt of assignments, waiting to be completed. Following this procrastination, a third bad habit, laziness, develops ",3,2,161

You have small states like Alaska and Hawii who only have 3 or 4 electoral votes and other larger states like Texas and Florida who have 29 or 38 Electoral votes.

59A565081D48,Conclusion.What I think about community service is something that a lot of people do around the world. In church school the nuns tell the people in church school to do community service do that we help the nuns in everything or we clean the garbage that is thrown in the floor. My friend OTHER_NAME use to do community service when he was still in church school he was dong community service. I never did that when I was in church school ,4,0,82
59A565081D48,Conclusion.People are lazy to do community service. Because they just wanna chill around with they're friends and they don't do they're homework. I do my homework every Friday I don't like doing it Saturdays or Sundays. I always get lazy or I go and chill with my friends. My mom doesn't like me being in the house locked so she lets me go outside and chill with my friends or I go with her to go shopping to the mall or we go to my brother house. I use to like being locked now I don't cause my head starts to hurt I feel like if I was in jail ,3,1,111

Cheers are heard across the county when his voice is heard on the phone announcing that school will be closed due to the weather. Both students and teachers embrace the well-needed break, using the time off to catch up on grading, get some much needed sleep, relax, pursue hobbies, or hang out with friends. Continuing the learning process on these days off would lead to stress for unprepared teachers and sleep-deprived students. However, when snow days and other such holidays start to build up, classes may fall behind in the curriculum. This would lead to teachers rushing to cover all the material before the AP test or state-mandated final exam, and students struggling to understand the new material so quickly ",4,2,147

Romeo and Juliet to help the students better understand the concepts. Activities such as these that are beneficial to students are not possible through distance learning, and could harm a student's level of understanding about a topic. Additionally, it is harder for students to get help when they do not understand new material or need clarification through distance learning. Traditionally, students can ask their teachers questions, visit their teachers during their office hours or study hall, or meet with a peer tutor. For distance learning, a student would have to video call or email their teacher, but it is much harder to explain or understand concepts without being able to meet in person. ",3,2,153

Unlike the human eye, the LIDAR radar sees anything and everything; not only does it never miss a single detail, but it also has a 360 degree view that current drivers simply do not possess. These sensors are expecially useful when backing up and driving backwards, as many drivers struggle with getting a full view of what goes on behind them. However, with the LIDAR radar, this problem is eliminated, making backwards driving easier. Putting radar into the drivers seat is not so much about losing the human touch of driving, but getting a more accurate perspective on the road. ",3,2,144

If someone was reading this and wanted the Electoral College, they could say that the big states would still have an advantage with more voters, and that is right, but they wouldn't be as big of prizes. So the election turns from a voice of the people, speaking up for a new leader, and turns into a mad chase to get the biggest prizes before the other party, like a game of Monopoly. In Monopoly, you buy areas with your money, and when someone lands on that space you own, they have to pay you. The places ath the end of the board have the priciest cost, but the best outcome. You can also build property on spaces to make the enemy players pay more. If you were to buy those, you practically win the game. On the other hand, the spaces at the begining are basiclly worthless, costing about 100 dollars and giving you about 1000. Those are like the small states, that have almost no value to the election, and the big states are worth a lot. ",3,2,230
607AB7FA0E57,Conclusion.Cell phones are going to take learning away from students if they have there phones with them all the time. ,0,2,21
607AB7FA0E57,Conclusion.Yes kids bring phones to school when they are not suppose to but not all of them use it during class. They only bring there phones for when school is over and if they need to call there mom or dad. I only bring my phone so that if something bad were to happening after school when i am walking home or if i need to call for a question i have my cell phone. I have never used my phone during school because it is going to get me off task. ,3,1,93
607AB7FA0E57,Concluding Statement.I hope that you will keep cell phones from use in school. I know that students will be mad at first but they will see when you let them bring there phones how unfocused it is during school. Kids have a lot of things going on in there life and when they have a cell phone i bet they talk about how they feel to there friends. Also it is a off task thing because of un answer questions they might have from a friend or some one. So please hear me out and do not let students use cell phones at all in school.      ,1,0,107
60C439A28A94,"Conclusion.This is not provided online; take home-schoolers, for example. Many home-schoolers report feeling socially isolated from people of their age group as a result of not having the social setting to thrive and form friendships in. These home-schoolers are not given the opportunity to create bonds with students because their classes are primarily online; it is because of their isolation that many home-schoolers find difficultly forming friendships with others. Online schooling and video conferencing takes away that social aspect of school, and can thus result in students who are unable to socialize with other people when it comes to the real world.

If these work than you can keep the required average at a C, but if these fail, that is when you would be obliged to make the required average a B so the students have more drive to keep their grades up.

6262ED336DBD,"Conclusion.The manufacturers have thought of a way to allow the car to drive and think for itself and allowing the driver to relax until they get notified that they should take control. Cars that are smarter will allow you to save more money and cost less mechanically, as well as save on fuel. ",3,0,54
6262ED336DBD,"Conclusion.Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver said, ""We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way."" In the car that he is overseeing, it uses heads-up displays and information systems that will notify you of an accident ahead or a roadblock that calls for a detour. The displays can be automatically turned off which is something not available to drivers who are texting and driving. Another detail would be that of manufacturers consideration of using cameras to watch the driver to make sure that the driver is paying attention if he or she needs to take control of the car. If the driver is paying attention to the road, then he will not need to be notified and or have the company of that car be notified. It allows the driver to pay closer attention to the road and not his surroundings. ",3,2,148
6262ED336DBD,"Conclusion.That is why manufacturers are considering using displays that will automatically turn themselves off so that the driver does not get distracted behind the wheel and cause a serious accident. GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object, which would then notify the driver that they are too close to an object and that they should stop immediately and look at their surroundings. All of the little gadgets that are put into this car as well as other cars, are allowing the driver to pay better attention to the road and the objects around him. Cars are getting smarter by the year which is reducing the number of accidents per day. Which is why driverless cars are a must for safety. ",3,2,132

These people make even less since because if it can happen here on our normla land it should be normal for a planet like mars to do it to. Mars is the most similair planet to ours.

When bigger states have more electoral votes, the candidates will be lead to thinking that if they get the bigger states, for example California who gets 55 electoral votes, to be in their favor then they might have a bigger chance at winning which will have the small states, like Hawaii who only gets 3 electoral votes, thinking that they have no say as to who gets to be their president.

669C59404DC1,"Conclusion.In the eleventh paragraph, in 'Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral Coolege: Why even the best-laid defences of the system are wrong', under 'What's wrong with the electoral college', its speaks of a ""disaster factor"". The ""disaster factor"" is when we vote for electors and they defy the will of the people; as this had almost happened with segregationists, nearly making the popular vote for Kennedy not go to Kennedy. As well as the fact that we could easily of had a tie in the electoral vote. As it says in the second source, the matter would fall into the hands of the House of Representatives ""...the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president."" This means each state has one vote, meaning the will of the people wouldn't have much say in the election. ",3,0,145
669C59404DC1,"Conclusion.People in a state all have the same electors, made by a popular vote, practically taking away the people's voice. If things were to change to popular vote we would all have a say in each election. ",0,0,38

66FE148BE39B,"Conclusion.Other times the state conventions, the presidential candidates, and sometimes the sate party's central committee. Voters think it's unfair. They spend a bunch of time voting for who THEY want, but in the end it comes down to the electors. So in reality it doesn't even matter who the voters choose.

671AEA2900EF,"Conclusion.The second source talks about the Indefensible Electoral College:Why even the best best-laid defenses of the system are wrong like in the first sentence ""What have Richard Nixion, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFl-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? The answer is Abolishing the electoral college! They're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore--thanks to the quirks of the electoral college--won the popular vote but lost the presidency, but over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This following year voter have expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency but yet the electoeral college still has its defenders. What give?...

671D0569C835,"Conclusion.Also, the electors are human beings, and everyone knows that humans are flawed creatures. According to Source 2, electors have been replaced to be against the opposing candidate or wait until the last minute to vote.

Candidates or even political parties can influence the electors to vote for their chosen person. ",3,2,70

67569429BA4F,"Conclusion.Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

6770F94889E2,"Conclusion.Money is a huge factor to this type of technology, can you imagine the cost of developing thousands and millions of cars that have such an advanced technology to be able to drive, brake, get to a destination all by itself? ",0,2,42
6770F94889E2,"Conclusion.Its pretty expensive to even to make a proto type or test run these so called ""Diverless Cars"". If a car like such is created how would the world be changed? Not only would the car itself be expensive to create but theres more factors to just creating the cars, its how the cars themslef work. In the article, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the author tells about some proto types or car similar to the ""Driverless car"" image. The authors gives an example about cars that uses sensors or radio signals that are telling the cars what to do. That means, the roads would have to give off certain signals that contribute to the car itself, the roads and lights would also have to have signals and sensors. It would cost tons of money to do things such as rebulid roads or lights so cars like these would properly worl. ",3,2,151
6770F94889E2,"Conclusion.The cars may never truly be driveless, technology cannot do everything humans do. There is always going to be times an actual driver may need to come in. Things such as, traffic or crashes or roadwork and there is no way of telling if driverless cars may be able to adapt to that. Not only is adapting a problem but is our technology advanced enough to have driverless cars? We as a society are advanced in the technology area but is it advanced enough to develop cars that are able to know where to go or what to do just like humans are? Technology things do not think like humans, they don't think at all, they have to be programed a certain way and there is always surprises or certain situations that these cars would not be able to do it properly or safely. ",3,2,145
6770F94889E2,"Conclusion.The cars technology may run into a problem later on that it, itself is not advanced enough to know exactly what to do so it may cause a person danger. The whole car is made of technology and we can not rely on it, things happens, technology may not always work. There has to be certain signals or things such as a battery life, or the technology may just fail altogether. If someone was to be in a driveless car and the system in the car or the technology were to crash was stops the car from doing the same? If the technology messes up and the car doesn't know when to stop it could cause a crash. Technology can never be completely relied on, until it can, there will always be safety issues or concerns and thats enough not to make something that could be very dangerous to someones life.

678A6C5DE012,"Conclusion.Say if there was to be a tie in electoral votes, the election would be given to the House of Representatives. Then the state delegations would vote for the president and the Senate would chose the vice president. When this would happen you would then not know who they were going to vote for and what your government's fate would be. So again if we had election by popular vote this wouldn't happen. ",3,0,74

67BD359D8BD2,"Concluding Statement.To sum it all up, the Electoral College isn't a smart way to help decide who should be president.

67D14DACC392,"Conclusion.Cold and flu season comes every year, leaving those who are unfortunate enough to have caught it, unable to attend school for at least a week, or however long a doctor recommends they should stay home. When these students come back to school, they are bombarded with make-up work that needs to be completed as soon as possible. Classes don't stop for students when they take a leave of absence. If students were able to attend online school, they wouldn't have to catch up on work because they would still be able to do it at home with the proper instructions and could still ask for help when needed. Teachers can get sick as well, sudden symptoms can make teachers leave abruptly without assigning work for students or leaving notes for substitutes. This sets students behind and could be prevented if students could attend online classes ",3,2,147

681279579E8A,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion, my point is not to require students for community service. Because it's just of course like forcing us again. For what I heard , slavery wasn't allowed in United States. We should get the right to do as we may, according to the law. Not everything , but in this case, we have the right to say no for educated students to perform community service by will. Some good may take in this course, but not all good. Though you think it'll be good for us students, learn some things. But for us, it's unfair and cruel. Somehow if you're volunteering as I wrote. It's okay because that's by their choice. So as I write this again, I say no to requiring students of our age and skill to do community service.      ",1,2,134
6874FC63CF20,"Conclusion.That is why self-driving cars will make roads safer and lead to less damage. Driverless cars take data they recieve from sensors, cameras, and GPS and they use this information to pick the smartest way to keep occupants safe on the road. Also the automated systems like driver assitance and antilock brakes that are already inside cars have proven that these programs will make driving safer. For example, antilock brakes function by detecting and then reacting to skids by apply brakes and reducing engine power. Therefore the driver is better able to avoid hazards and maintain control in dangerous situations. Google has also already tested some of their semi-driverless cars and these vehicles have not crashed in half a million miles. As proven by already installed automated features, technology will continue to make drivers and passangers safer. The next step in this technology is a self-driving car that will limit the amount of error that can be cost lives. ",3,2,160

The person at first may think like why do I have to take care of something just because I don't do my homework. If you tell them they have to volunteer in a dog shelter they wont want to do it but if you also tell them they are in charge of everything and that if anything goes wrong it would be their fault. The student will probably get scared and do everything it takes to do everything good. After community service is over he will probably be a better student by doing his homework.

6A088E8BBE02,"Conclusion.If there was a tie in the election, the election would be given to the House of Representatives. In that election, each state has only one vote. So a state with a bigger population has the same say than a state with a smaller population. According to Plumer, because many voters vote one party for president and another party for Congress, the House's selection will not entirely reflect the will of the people. A tie in the electoral college is possible beacause the amount of electoral votes is 538 which is an even number (source 3). ",3,2,97
6A088E8BBE02,"Conclusion.Counterclains suggest that because the election depends on the vote of swing states, voters there are more thoughtful and should be the ones to decide how the election goes (Richard A. Posner, source 3). ",2,2,35
6A088E8BBE02,"Conclusion.The comment that voters in swing states are more thoughtful is vague (not all voters in swing states have to be media literic), and it is unfair to other states if only the swing states are important to the canidates.

6C30C0076FAD,"Conclusion.Whether interacting with family or speaking to friends, students experience social interaction rather often in their lives. Additionally, as many distance learning programs use video conferences as a means to teach, they can provide a means to teach further social and emotional interaction as well. Schools are not the only means by which students may develop social skills, and distance learning would genuinely not hinder any sort of societal interaction or ability that traditional schools seemingly provide.

6CA3EC0D0FC8,"Concluding Statement.It is true that driverless cars can benefit people, but it can also bring danger and concerns. I am against the development of driverless cars. First, safety will always be a concern. Driverless would not be completely safe because safety is best achieved with alert drivers. The drivers would not be completely alert if they were in a driveless car. In addition, the production and the cost to buy driverless cars would be high.

6D757AA2C340,"Conclusion.The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your states electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are usually voting for your candidates electors.

Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidates political party, but state laws vary on how the elecotrs are selected and what their responsibilities are.

The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. So when you vote for your president your acually voting for the slate of electors. ",3,1,132

The elctoral college consist of the selection of the electors the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president and the counting of the electoral votes by congress and i feel like thats a little too much when people can just vote instead of getting someone as a president who their not comfortable with or familiar with and dont know anything about the person so everyone just vote by the people for the people.    ,1,0,150

Process consists of the selection of the electors, the metings of the electors where they vote for president and Vice President. The electoral college consists of 538 electors and the majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. The amount of members in its congressional delegation, ""one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two of your Senators"". The candidate that's running for president in your state has it's own group of electors.

Back in 1960. segregationalists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in relpacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)

-source 2, second paragraph.

This is stating that in 1960 people who opposed Kennedy nearly became his electors. So if they succeeded in becoming his electors his votes would have gone to another opposing candidate. This could not happen with a system of voting that directly conected everyones votes with congress. This was a clear case of sabotage in the election of 1960. ",3,0,123

7B1981581BC7,"Conclusion.According to Bradford Plumer the electors chosen, ""...depend on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves."" On top of that Bradford indentifies the electors as, ""...anyone not holding a public office."". Bradford Plumer illustrates better than anyone that the electors chosen are average citizens who think the same as the rest of the general population while still keeping in mind that Congress must also be represented. Knowing this, the working-class people of America, and Congress can rest easy knowing that the electoral college process will make the decision that is best for the nation as a whole. This decision making, whether directly or indirectly, unifies the country. In 2012 more than three-fourths of the nation tuned in to watch the presidential election; in the end being one of the most watched televised elections in the country's history. This number includes Congressmen. This shows that the decision making process of the electoral college brings all the people of the nation together to decide on the choosing of the coutries next leader.

7B1981581BC7,"Concluding Statement.While there have been a few flaws in the electoral college throughout history, this decision making process still unifies the people of America and is still, most importantly, part of its roots. More than anything, the electoral college process represents the two sides of the country: Congress and the average working class citizen. So, rest easy knowing that the next election, there is a process between Congress and average working citizens that works to make the decision that is best for the people of this great nation, the United States of America.

Then the student couldn't take care of their community service hours. Another is what if a student participated in sports and had an important game to go to. That means that they couldn't finish their hours as well.

7C8094BF63DE,"Conclusion.Presidential candidates focus on gaining the majority vote of large states in order to obtain more electors. A large state such as California containing over 35 million voters should have as much of a say in electing a president as a small state like Wyoming only containing 500,000 voters. The Electoral College makes sure that the ""majority"" of voters doesn't decide an election and everyone has a say. The ""winner takes all"" system evens out the playing field for all those little states who want just as much of a say in determining a new president as a large one does. ",3,0,103

7CE8F3872E67,"Conclusion.Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the district of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purpose of the Electoral College. The electors are generally chosen by the candidates political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. The president only haves four years, it is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. When you vote for your state they have a thing called winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportional representation. When the election is done they have a thing they do called Certificated of Ascertainment it lists all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Ascertainments are then sent to the Congress and then to the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. ",3,1,166

7E4687A7CAB1,"Conclusion.To begin with, manufacturers have tinkered on this project for many years by several strategies such as General Motors and their concept car that ran on a unique test track.

It began in the 1950s, using binary code to alert the car system.

Unfortunately, upgrades in that period of time were too expensive to be used widespread.

This began the alternative option of smarter cars, rather than intellegent roads to assist drivers.

Likewise, the government is obstinant on testing for every single liability smarter cars can be held for.

It is above all priorities for the smarter cars to ensure complete saftey from dangerous hazard conditions on the road.

To prevent such conditions, developers considered the use of driverless cars to assist drivers instead of total control at all times.

Furthermore, scientists and engineers have added ideas from each other, enabling cars to even sensor dangerous obstacles.

For example, the BMW ""Traffic Jam Assistant,"" is one of the many cars that can preform driverless to a certain extent, allowing for a human driver to access the controls if necessary. ",3,0,181
7E492FFD9778,"Conclusion.Say you are driving down the road and a child runs out infront of you, does the car automatically stop or does it hit the child.

The cars would also need a gps so that you could let it know where to take you because its not going to know automatically want to go to grandmas house that night. ",3,0,77
7E492FFD9778,"Concluding Statement.A driverless car is not needed in this world.

876A650B692E,"Conclusion.Many students in the world are placed with the issue of whether or not it would be beneficial to actually attend school in a brick and mortar setting. Some find it beneficial, allowing the students to have a taste of freedom an independence in their work environment, while others think of it as an excuse to stay home and slack off. Pushing that agenda forward, many schools offer students the opportunity to take some of their classes off campus at a different location such as a community college campus or even in the comforts of their own homes. With that being said, more students are choosing to take their classes at different locations instead of the traditional setting. ",4,2,119
876A650B692E,"Conclusion.Many students face the intense pressures of being in a brick and mortar school environment and often can't handle it, becoming very uncomfortable where they are and losing sight of themselves in the stress. By pulling those students out of the environment that hinders their ability to learn and retain information properly due to their stress and lack of comfort, and placing them into an environment where they can prosper, retain and possibly learn faster can truly help students become better and more confident in themselves and the work they put out to the world. When students are constantly stressed out in their school setting, it makes it harder for them to excel in their studies, even when it isn't a subject that is particularly hard for them, so allowing them the extra educational freedom of choosing how they want to take their classes, whether it be completely at home on the computer, completely physical in a brick and mortar buliding, or some mixture of the two, students can combat their educational stress.

Now, the words of a fourteen year old might not mean much to a state senator, especially since it will be four years until I am legally allowed to vote, but please sir, hear me out ",4,2,72
89039D21E960,Conclusion.I believe that we should keep the Electoral College for many reasons. ,5,0,13
89039D21E960,"Conclusion.As stated in the third article, paragraph 19, ""...because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" Also in the paragraph, it states that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. If the president was decided by popular vote, however, can you imagine what it would be like? Take Romney, for example. He was a solid regional favorite in the South. Romney knew that there was no incentive to campaign heavily in the South, because he would not gain any electoral votes by increasing his plurilaty in states he knew he would win. If popularity decided the president, residents of the other regions might feel like their vote would not count, and that the president would have no regard for their interests. Say that popularity did actually determine a winner. While most regions might vote for a certain presidents, the ones that did not would feel like that the man running the country wasnt really ""their president"". However, Mr. Senator, if the Electoral College was to stay, this problem would never exist. With the system we have now, the people vote for your state's electors when they vote for the president. Most states also have a ""winner-take-all"" system. Therefore, the canidate with the most votes in a state win's that state's electors. This lets the voting be even, fair. A popular vote would make the voting unfair to those who did not want that president. ",3,2,246
89039D21E960,"Conclusion.I can see how this could support changing to election by popular vote, and how it could be reasonable. If our president was chosen by popular vote, then he would visit all of the states, trying to win them over. However, there are some strong arguments against this. To begin with, one man would have to visit 50 states, and even if he only visited the majority, there is still a posibility that the state will not vote for him anyways, in the end. If we keep the Electoral College, then the majority of votes in a state would count, not his popularity. As a fourteen year old, I can relate this to highschool. A student can be the most popular student in the school, but they can also be the most rude and mean. And while another student may not be popular, they can be the nicest in the school. If the president was chosen by a popular vote, he might just end up being the worst thing that could happen to the country. ",6,2,176
89039D21E960,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion, Mr. State Senator, I think that keeping the Electoral College is the best thing for our country. If we changed to election by popular vote, the man (or woman) might not be the best for our country, and the best man might not win because he is not a regional favorite. I hope, sir, that you will take my letter into account when you go to vote on this topic.            ",1,2,74

Perhaps this is because of the lack of information I'm given about our government, or perhaps its because what the electoral college does is quite irrelevant to me and my fellow peers. ",4,1,100
8B5A7E5D7BB5,Conclusion.I would keep the Electoral Collage. ,5,0,7
8B5A7E5D7BB5,"Conclusion.So we can still vote for President and also Vice President. The Electoral Collage consists of 538 electors. Majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state puposes of ElectoralCollage.

Each candidate running for President has his or her own group of electors. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. Most states have a ""winner take all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate.

After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with with the names of their respective electors. Your state's Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

The Electoral Collage is windely regared as anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed however it is entirly possible that the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Electoral Collage avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only 43  percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral Collage 301 and 370 electoral votes respectively.    ",3,1,296
8B64BA63E623,"Conclusion.Two, Electoral College is unfair to voters because of the winner-take-all system. ",0,0,13
8B64BA63E623,"Conclusion.Also Electoral College prevents run-off elections to occur. for example in source three, the electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes casted. ",2,0,33
8B64BA63E623,"Conclusion.This causes lots of pressure which would greaatly complicate the presidential election process. With Electoral Collage, this produces a clear winner. ",6,0,22
8B7A871FC14B,Conclusion.But the outcome of all this is that electoral college vite is possible an its less likely to dispute over the popular vote. A electoral vote is possible because the total number of vites is 538 is an even number. ,3,0,41
8B7A871FC14B,Concluding Statement.So to rap it all up it can be argued that the electoral collge method of selecting the president may turn off pontenial voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying for their state. voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election ,1,1,64

Google came up with the idea that when the driver should be prepared to take over the car flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays will appear thats a bad idea I say that because what if the lights appear on the dashboard an the driver begans to take over an soon as the lights go away the driver hits another car or a pedestrian?

8D69369DEDA2,"Conclusion.The electoral college is a very important process in congress. It gives citizens that are in the college a chance to meet the people that will be running for a very powerful position. Sometimes voices arent heard and of these 528 people, some will be humble. its also a good thing that they use a majority ruling system, which can make things easier instead of detailing. ",4,0,67
8D69369DEDA2,"Conclusion.If you leave it to the electoral college, then only those people will be able to have a say in who we want as president for the united states of america. However if we leave it to just popularity, whoever has more money will get the votes and win.

8E938A38BA43,"Conclusion.The Electoral College consists of 539 electors, according to paragraph 3.

A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for the president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. The Founding Fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and the lection of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

8EEB5226121C,"Conclusion.This immediatly shows faults of the electoral college. What kind of government is running the world's super-power? One that ignores its people and bombs governments of other countries for doing the same thing? The electoral college takes away from the value of the vote- a right for which the United States of America was founded.

8F6F0CD4986A,"Conclusion.. If a regular car gets into an accident, we have laws that say who should be at fault. Also, it can already be complicated to figure out who should take the blame today with regular cars. If we all drove driverles cars, a new stack of laws would have to be made to support them. Getting used to those laws would be hard because we have never lived in the world of driverless cars. In the article it says, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" This is a good point. If there is an accident where someone gets injured, not everyone will agree who should take the fall for it. There will be riots and fighting between manufacturers and individuals, and overall, it is not worth it. We should not destroy what we already have for something this risky. ",3,2,152

9329A9DD13F2,"Conclusion.Every student has a different way of learning, so, many students struggle through classes because they are not being taught the way they learn best. Some students learn best by taking notes, while others learn by doing hands on activities. Some students can hear something once and be able to understand fully, while others take more time to process. At home classes gives students the ability to take the time they need to learn material and complete classwork. One student may only have to listen to a teacher lecture and take little to no notes to understand a topic. Another student may need to listen, take extensive notes, and reread or write their notes in order to gain a fraction of the understanding, but they are not able to do this in class. If the expectation in a class is that you are able to complete an activity after 30 minutes of a teacher talking, but that is not how some students learn, those students will be lost and fall behind the others. With classes at home and online, they would be able to take the time they needed to grasp a topic before moving on to use what they just learned. At home learning allows students to practice the learning style that helps them learn the best. ",3,2,219

9C1132980450,"Conclusion.Television and movies have developed a theory of these cars. The theory is how the car may look and also, drive. Google has had cars that could drive independently under certain circumstances since 2009. Google cars have driven over half a million miles without a crash. google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and a inertial motion sensor.

Companies are already, and have already, been making these computer driven cars. As an example, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track. The track was embedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car. Google made the modified Toyota Prius, and BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020.

These, ""driverless"" cars are not really driverless. Antilock brakes and driver assistance still seem a long way from the dream of calling a driverless carb to take us wherever we desire, but Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google Car project, believes that the technology has finally begun to catch up to the dream. The Google Cars must have an alert driver when driving. The Google Car cannot pull in and out of driveways. When dealing with road contrustion or navigating through an accident, the driver must take over then as well. The BMW, ""Traffic Jam Assistant,"" can reach speeds up to 25 miles per hour, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills.

9C9F8BC72552,"Conclusion.Cell phones should only be used after school hours, dismissal, if they need to get a ride home. Other than that it is not necessary to have phones in school and be using them to talk to each other. Kids would not be following the rules made if they could have their phones with them, they would carry them and never turn them off during a class. Teachers would have build-ups of students phones because the students basically would care about when they could use it, they would do as they please and get their phones taken away. This rule would probably effect most high-school and middle-school students, not elementary students. The older students would not be following rules and would act as though they do not care about the rule, all they'd care about is the fact that they could have phones. During classes like gym and health and foreign language people would use their phones because people would not care about those classes, they may see it as a free period like a directed study/study hall.

With this system political infulence is restored to the larger states making the canidates focuss on the more populous areas. More power to the more populous states also means that run-off elections are avoided. In 1992 and in 1968 run-off elections were avoided due to the use of the Electoral College; ""Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College"" P.22.

If we were to switch the way things are now, that would not happen.  A poll taken in 2000 called the Gallup poll, showed that over 60% of voters prefered a direct election rather then the kind we have now.  This took place when Al Gore recieved the popular vote, but lost the electoral votes.  You can see that the current system has its flaws.

A2A80E683990,"Conclusion.People have been fascinated with driverless cars since the late 1950's. For example, in the late 1950's, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a soecial track. this track had been embedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car. Engineer at Berkeley tried the same thing but this time they used magnetics with alternating polarity. The car would read positive and negative polarity messages in Binary code. The ""smart-road"" systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to the existing roads, but they were way to expensive.

In the 1980's automakers would use speed sensors at the wheel in the creation of antilock breaks. Within 10 years, these sensors had become more advanced to detect and resopnd to danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. the information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine. this alowed better response and control than any human could manage alone.

Sebastian Thrun, founder of the google car project, believes that the technology has finally began to catch up to the dreams. Before the 2000's, they didn't have all the sensors, the computers, or the mapping. the Radar was a device that cost two hundred thousand milion dollars.

A2A80E683990,"Conclusion.In 2013, BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" This car could handle driving speeds up to 25 mph. This car had special touch sensors to make sure thatthe driver keeps their hands on the wheel. The cars could steer,accelerate, and brake themselves, but if there were any traffic incidents, the car would require human skills. This means that the driver would have to stay alert as if they were driving. To keep the driver alert, GM has developed seats that vibrate the driver's seat when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The google the car announces when the driver should be prepared to take over the wheel. Also, other options for the cars driver to stay alert is flashing on the windshield and on the heads up displays. Manufacturing is also considering cameras to watch the driver or make sure that they are remaining focused on the road ",3,0,157

A2FA635C9590,"Conclusion.When the average citizen does vote, however, their vote does not go toward the president. Their vote goes to the Electoral College, who then vote for the president. ""[...] it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote"" (Posner 16). ",3,2,51
A2FA635C9590,"Conclusion.Basically, all that a candidate even needs is the majority votes of the Electoral College in order to win an election. ""[...] according to a Gallup pole in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore - thanks to the quirks of the electoral college - won the popular vote but lost the presidency[...]"" (Plumer 9). Collecting the votes of the Electoral College is the only concern of a candidate - therefore the only reason that candidates speak to the people is to influence them to cast votes for the Electoral College, which then cast votes for that candidate. ""[...] Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes [...]"" (Posner 18). It's as if the people are just physical steps that electoral voters use to get to the person that the Electoral college wants to be the president of the U.S.

""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always"" (Plumer 10). As mentioned in the article by Richard A. Posner, members of the Electoral College are chosen and expected to vote for their party's nominee. However, people don't always deliver what we expect from them. It is completly possible for an elector to change their mind, and cast their finalizing vote toward the opposite candidate. These members cast their votes directly to the candidate, and they can easily change their vote.                       ",3,2,238

A37EC2666F34,Conclusion.But this can all be due to the fact that the electoral system was made by our founding fathers on the Constitution so it may only be natural that they support it ,6,1,33
A37EC2666F34,"Conclusion.A good arguement was when the system allowed for far worse when the electors for defy the will of people like in passage 2 it says ""in 1960 when segragationists in the louisiana legislature almost succeeded in replacing electors who would appose John F. Kenedy"" that is just evil.  Although the law has not been changed since the Constitution was made. ",3,0,62
A37EC2666F34,"Conclusion.They saddly dont visit every state in passage 2 it says ""Candidates dont spend time in states they know they have 0 chance of winning, focusing only on tight races"" Although the winner take all is made just to do what they are using it for by awarding electors to the presidential candidate (exept for Maine and Nebraska) it is being used for what they are using it for ",3,0,70

"" whatever that make you comfortable for you to learn "". For me is going to school learn amd talk to other students. Wahtever you chosses for you to do then do it.

A42A600EEB0D,"Conclusion.
When students are absent, they are absent for a reason, whether good or bad.

They are not able or willing to attend school, and they are not going to attend online classes from home. 
",0,2,35
A42A600EEB0D,"Conclusion.A student who is too sick to attend school, needs to rest, and concentrate on getting better so they can attend school, not worry about the assignments they have to do or lessons they need to learn.

If school is canceled for inclement weather, many students might lose power or internet service and not be able to get work done.

Students who have to travel often due to highly competitive sports do not have time to work on assignments while at tournaments, games, and competitions, but coaches for clubs and travel programs have rules about the grades their athletes have to keep to be able to play and travel; this will keep athletes from getting far behind and from being unprepared on graded assignments on new subjects. It would not be beneficial for students to have virtual learning because, when students are not going to come to school they are not going to do school work. 
",3,2,157
A42A600EEB0D,"Concluding Statement.While distance learning may seem great, it is not practical or time effective.

Distance learning and virtual lectures may seem like a great way to adapt the classroom to more modern standards, but is not time effective, realistic or easily accessible to all.

Students will not benefit from being able to attend classes from home it would only waste the time of teachers and students who do the assignments.

Technology issues are too great a problem for virtual classrooms to be practical and when a student does not come to school they are not going to attend an online lecture of do extra school work at home.

Students are not able to get the same quality information and education from an online video as they get from a lesson given by a teacher in person that can be adapted for each class.

Online distance learning is not beneficial to students, and should not be implemented in schools. ",1,2,159
A42D860C93B0,"Conclusion.The electoral college has been around for 100-200 years now. When are founding fathers came to this country, they never said to have a voting system like this. ",0,0,29
A47BE7BB6F08,"Conclusion.The Electoral college is a proccess that was established in the constitution by the founding fathers as a compromise between the votes in congress and popular vote of certified citizens that leads to how they select the president.

The Electoral college has electors who actually vote for the president  and these votes are counted by congress. The Electoral college holds 538 electors , but it is required the at least 270 electors must vote in order to elect a president. ",3,1,80
A47BE7BB6F08,"Conclusion.The electoral college has been a way of electing our president for years , but there is one question . Do the peoples votes really matter? ",0,2,25
A47BE7BB6F08,"Conclusion.In the electoral college there has been cases where the people voted for a president but yet the electors chose otherwise , so are they really representing our votes or are they just getting Americans to believe that their votes actually count? ",3,0,42
A47BE7BB6F08,"Conclusion.The electoral college method  may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. The fact that they feel their vote has no effect, they pay less attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. ",3,2,50
A49E1A5FA91B,Conclusion.I believe we should abolish it completely. I believe that we should change our voting system to election by popular vote for the president of the United Sates. ,5,2,29
A49E1A5FA91B,"Conclusion.it doesnt at all, for you are not choosing which presidential candidate to vote for, you are voting for someone else to vote for the president who might not always stay true to their word and vote for a different candidate. ",6,2,42
A4C33694BE0C,"Conclusion.For example,""'It reminds me most of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin.""(12) This quote provides evidence that the figure/landform on Mars is similar to landforms on Earth. So, this is evidence that the figure on Mars is just a landform like what we have on Earth. ",3,0,55

A4C9096A123B,Conclusion.And The Electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. The electoral college method for selecting presidents may turn off potential voters for a canidate who has no carrying their state. ,3,1,42

A57F5B6E1247,"Conclusion.With our current system, hundreds of thousands of Americans votes don't matter. This mass of people is citizens of eligibility to vote. Where are there rights? What does this say about our system? The ""winner takes all theory"" ignores voters. If a state leans 51% democrat, then the entire state is accounted for the democratic party. What about those 49% of republicans. Where does their vote go? - down the toliet along with the credibility and accuracy of the electoral college. ",3,2,82

Here are my three examples that prove that its just a mesa ",5,0,22

A6504C463F7E,"Conclusion.One reason why it's just a mesa is, theres lots of mesas on Earth and Mars ",0,0,17
A6504C463F7E,Concluding Statement.To conclude these are the reasons why its not aliens. NASA would get more funding if they said it was aliens. They took a clearer picture of it in 2001 and it proved it wasnt a face. Lastly we have lots of mesas on Earth and someone siad theyd seen one like The Face on Mars by a river in Idaho ,1,0,63
A67A947BBFB7,"Conclusion.Politicts have been around for centuries; politics were made to keep the peace and give everyone a fair expresion to the people. We have all herd of people in political standpoint have been corrupt, but what if our own voting system was corrupt and our votes have never made a diffrence in selecting a president by the people. When we vote for our selected president is it really going to change or make a diffence on who gets elected... right? ""of course it will make a diffrence."" As long as your states electors dont choice by who they feel is the best fit for presidency. On another note what about the Electoral college votes. Why does one canidate always get all the electoral college votes from one state? Why cant we just revert to how many votes the canidate gets? ",4,2,142

Sometimes Generic_Name goes out to eat for lunch and she wakes up later than normal elementary kids do.

A6B490224E67,Conclusion.I think that the head was form by itself when the heat from Mars rise and it burn some of the rock and form the big head. I don't think it was made by alien because if they were in Mars they would burn when the sun come or when the heat rise from Mars ,5,1,56

A723DDC8ABF0,"Conclusion.Community Service is basically helping others in a way where you accept nothing in return. Some activities that are community service include picking litter up around your neighborhood, visiting the elderly, helping a teacher, etc. It's the little things we can do. ",3,0,43
A723DDC8ABF0,Conclusion.The reason for this is because the student may learn that just by helping someone that it can mean a whole lot to that one person; which may or may not lead them to realising the important things in life and the things they value. ,3,0,46
A7642F5617E0,"Conclusion.I understand that some people in this world do not care about our community at all, but it is very important to at least try to change it ",4,2,29

A774A4991BB1,Conclusion.The Electoral College has been here since the founders of this country put it in our Constitution to please both sides. This Electoral College has made a lot of history in our great nation and we appreciate what it has done for us. It's a huge part of our election process ,4,2,52

A798DC70F3FC,Conclusion.If you look back at the probloms we had in the past we got passed them and came back stronger and improved we really just need new electors and just keep the system the same but get out with the old people and in with the new ones ,3,1,49

A7A467BDEE14,"Conclusion.Through this one argument, advocates are essentially assuming anyone who doesn't live in a swing state doesn't care about the election as much and therefore they shouldn't have a say in the matter. This is simply not true. ",6,2,39

A7EC6F462F8B,"Conclusion.Google's own self driving cars have been able to driver over half a million miles without a crash. (Paragraph 2) Here we can see that the technology is there, it just has not been able to be implemented and the law has not caught up to where self driving cars are ",3,0,52
A7EC6F462F8B,Conclusion.. People would become better connected in a world occupied by self driving cars. ,0,2,14
A7EC6F462F8B,"Conclusion.Technology has been developed that allows for the driver to be alerted to a hazerdous situation by vibrating the seats, flashing a light, or finding another way to notify the driver. (Paragraph 7) The technology is present to allow self driving cars to function, it just needs some fine tuning. Cars that have been made by these manufactures ""... can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves,"" (Paragraph 7) ",3,0,69
A7EC6F462F8B,"Conclusion.It is important to understand why driverless cars propose a danger to us, however, because the benefit of an automated car is not gained without risks and challengs. ",2,2,29
A7EC6F462F8B,"Conclusion.Driverless cars, at this very moment, are not capable of dealing with complicated traffic situations or roadblocks, and this is primarily the argument for why these cars should not be allowed on the open road. Other arguments include the reasoning that the enjoyment is being taken out of driving by allowing a computer to do the driving for you. In regards to that, I respond by saying that cars that will have automated features will also be able to be driven. Most are not completely autonomous and will allow for the driver to take control at their leisure. ",3,2,99
A7EC6F462F8B,"Conclusion.A driverless car could be used as a weapon for a group not willing to lose their own members in a fight, ",3,0,23
A7EC6F462F8B,"Conclusion.We have the power to travel anywhere and drive anywhere without worrying about fatigue or losing your way. We could leave Chicago one night, get a good nights rest, and wake up in Washington D.C., parked at your hotel. A fully developed automated car society would help to reduce the risk of collisions and would reduce emmissions that are harmful to the enviroment. Advanced technology has become more readily available to the consumer in recent years and allows for the driverless car to be cheaper and easier to produce than ever before when technology that these cars required was but a dream. Driverless cars could allow for a safer society that is more connected with transport that is cheaper and more reliable than that of the traditional car. Greater fuel efficiency and the lower enviromental impacts would promote the development of these cars by companies wishing to see a better world. ",3,2,153
A803835B8164,Conclusion.It is not fair that the general population does not get an independent vote. ,0,0,15
A803835B8164,"Conclusion.it is dependent upon which party the elector chooses. Voters don't have control over who their electors vote for. As said in the second article, Al Gore won the popular vote in 2000 against Bush however, Gore lost the electoral vote resulting in the loss of the presidential election. In the past, there have been voters who refused to vote for their party's candidate and voted for whomever. There is also the concern of a tie in the electoral vote.

If that were to happen then there would certainly be no chance that the popular vote would have an impact on the selection of the president because it would now be in the hands of the House of Representatives. ",3,0,120
A817C51F0787,"Conclusion.That would have been big proof that aliens do exist. After all scientists have been trying to look for any other life on other planets for over the years. So that just says NASA also sees it as just a natrual landform.

A850DCCFB6DE,Conclusion.Many people would say that it is as if they don't have right that it's unfair that someone is picking their future ,2,0,23
A850DCCFB6DE,"Conclusion.but its not true!!!.The people choose the electors you vote for which ever one you think will represent you best, you would vote for them. ",6,0,27
A8683674019F,"Conclusion.because that would mean that all the other presidents in the past would not have even been our Presidents, the history behind them would be rubish and not even true. Some states may have a ""winner-take-all"" sort of thing but they are together and voting together as on state. Some of them may vote for the other one but the majority of them is for one person. Some of the states believe that it is not even worth it to have a ""winner-take-all"", because they think it is unfair. Then after the presidential election comes the ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" which is a list of all those who ran for President and there respective electors. ",3,0,115
A8683674019F,"Conclusion.because you guys are giving out the information on the candidates to late or not at all. That SUCKS, for most states because they may not even get one advertisment about the candidates any where or even a commercial on T.V. ",3,0,43
A8E73414941A,"Conclusion.As most of you know, the presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday afer the first Monday in November. This is when there are two candidates running to be President of the United States ",3,0,38
A8E73414941A,Conclusion.the reason why this happens is because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates electors. ,3,0,22
A8E73414941A,"Conclusion.Under the Electoral College system, voters vote for the state of electors and not for the president. The state of electors elect the president. The electors are bacically anyone not holding public office. The people who pick who it is, can be chosen from variaties of places. It could be the presidential candidates themselves, or it could be the states party central commitee, or it could be the state conventions. Each state only casts one vote ",3,0,77
A8E73414941A,"Conclusion.The Electoral College is unfair to voters becuase of the winner take all system, ",0,0,15
A8E73414941A,"Conclusion.no other region has enough Electoral votes to elect a President. The votes can be very close to the same number of both candidates, and thats a tough situation ",3,0,30
A8F2D9005A0A,"Conclusion.That is more than half of the United States population, therefore we should get rid of it. I believe that we should abolish it along with that 60 percent, thatway when voting, it will be much more fair. Also, it will make choosing the president of the U.S. up to the people. ",3,0,54
A8F2D9005A0A,"Conclusion.Other reasons are because it gives certainty of an outcome, helps big states, and avoids run-off elections, ",2,0,18
A9105216AAA3,"Conclusion.The Google cofounder Sergey Brin says that the cars ""would use half the fuel of toay's taxis."" There is a large fear of increasing gas prices and lack of natural resources in the world today. The production of driverless cars would quell those fears as they are much more fuel efficient than the cars used today. Brin also states that the cars would ""offer far more flexibility than a bus."" This is crucial as the bus usually has a route that it must adhere to while the driverless car can go straight to the desired location. This aspect also positively impacts the environment. ",3,2,106
A91A08E523D5,Conclusion.Therefore having the Electoral College consist of 538 electors. I still woudl feel a part of the voting ,3,0,19
A924B3431D21,Conclusion.The reason I say this is because every elector do there job by picking the president that will run for the U.S.It also helps pick out the vice president as well like I said in my first paragraph. That is why we should keep the electoral college. The electors help pick out the president that we need for everyone. ,3,1,62
A924B3431D21,Conclusion.A president can do so much for us like Barack Obama. He did great things to keep this nation secure for the people. Other great president did the same thing back then. Because of the electors from the electoral college. Those electors helped pick a president so we can have one and that is why we need the electoral college. ,3,0,61
A93FA7E8FB81,"Conclusion.I believe that the electoral college should be changed and be ended oncce and for all. 
",5,0,17
A93FA7E8FB81,"Conclusion.Why should everyone be putting they're trust with votes into people they dont know? Even when I read the passage I saw that the electors could possibly get confused and vote the wrong way and if many of them end up doing that you can ultimately end up with the wrong president.

AABDFA8D20B1,Conclusion.Driving without driveless cars was a joy and something people love to do but with driveless cars it ruins the experinece as you do not get to control the car anymore and just have to watch it drive itself. This has been a big problem for car companies as they have to get people to buy their car and enjoy the ride and the car and companies do not know how to do that. Werner Huber who is the BMW project manger said that with cars being able to drive by themselves they have to find new ways to attract and make the costumers enjoy the car and they can not find a way to do that without putting the driver adn the passengers at risk. The only things they have founded to make the car enjoyable to drive with driveless cars is entrainment systems or texting but all these may be enjoyable to the driver but also puts the driver at risk. ,3,2,164

Google cofounder Sergey Brin begs to differ. He believes that their may be a start towards driverless cars.

Sergey Brin imagines a future where numerous amounts of driverless car could form a public-transport taxi system. He believes that this could one day become a reality. Driverless car production should still continue over the next several years. Although driverless cars have drove over 500 miles without crashing, there are still setbacks. Driverless car would still have to alert the driver while backing out of driveways and navigating themselves through road issues such at construction zones and accidents with other drivers. Driverless car so far can drive, turn, and brake, but there are still somethings that the driver would still have to do.

Although the production of driverless cars is still just underway, there is still much more to be done. In the future, driverless cars may be available to everyone someday. There is still a long way to go, but we are getting closer to achieving this everyday.       ",3,1,199

Community service helps out a lot in our lives, by both building character and also it helps tremendously in applying for college.

This was very helpful for us and we benefited a lot because of that. They probably also felt better about themselves that they were teaching the younger generation and helping us out.

B25D365F5C1C,"Conclusion.electrol college is not just a college it is a process,  The electoral college is a process that consist of the selection of the electors,  it started in the founding fathers established in the constitution as a comprise between election of the president . this means that the electorol college should stay this college is more than just any old college its history ,its in the constitution this college should not be gone this college should be honored. these electorals mainly select the votes for the people in the white house like the president and vice predident. our state is entitled allotment of electors equals the nuimber of memebers in the congressional delegation  ",4,0,113
B25D365F5C1C,"Conclusion.under the 23 amendment of the constitution , the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and a treated like a state for purpose of the electoral college . this means that because of the electoral college the district of columbia is treated like a state . so electoral college  is the reason why some districts are called a state why take this type of college away if this has such a big role in alot of things to do with the congress . with out the electoral college they wouldnt have presidents or any thing . in every election the electors are always there in every president election every president have their own group of electors behind them . they are joined by a canidates political party ",3,1,123
B25D365F5C1C,Conclusion.it wouldnt be anything with out electors they do more than just stand behind the president they do more they help the president the president we have today wouldnt be able to run for president without a group of electors . and they need a college for someone who wants to be an elector. this college should be honored to be in a program like that these electors are needed in our country with out electors we would have nothing if we didnt have electors the electoral college is widely know as an non democratic method of selecting a president that outa be by declaring the canidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner . ,3,1,115
B25D365F5C1C,Concluding Statement.these are all the reasons why we need the electors program . because they play in a big role of our country and dthey also good for our state and .l so we need these progems to show young student that being an elector is not easy itbis very hard and a long process and we need to show students how the experience is and they also need to be knowleged trained to do stuff that will make our country better . because if they mess up  on one little thing its an automatic fire for them . we need these colleges because it plays a big role and it reuires the votes. of the president meaining it helps the president win . ,1,0,121

They feel that because they dont live in a big state like Texas they do not have equal say in the decisions our country makes. In the article Plumer wrote, "" In the same vein, faithless electors have pccasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they please..."". The Electoral College is changing peoples mind set on how to vote because they feel why should we care if the government does not, can you blame them? If we just took out the simple problem of the Electoral College more voters will vote honestly rather then go with everyone elses vote. ",3,2,145
B29198FD0748,Conclusion.Another reason i feel we should favor the popular vothing system is because this would show that the soon to be presidents should vist all of there voters rather then the ones they know they will probably win. ,0,2,39
B29198FD0748,"Conclusion.What i mean is ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Americans have always wanted to be in power and have a say in what we do but in the case of voting we do not. By doing this we are allowing the government to make all of the decisions for us, as if we were children. When you turn to the legal age for vothing your vote should count. With this majority does not rule, for instance say our votes of 46 percent and 54 percent were to come in. The man of the 46 percent still has a chance of winning when the people had already voted. The problem with that is at that point the peoples word goes out the window, and the government once again jumps in demanding that they choose. ",3,2,152

The only thing that will be in their mind is the fear from that other person bothering them again and bullying them which includes; abusing them, insulting them or taking something from them like their food. This proves my claim by saying students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they won't have to worry about being bullied or having any problems and they will be able to focus very well.

Studies show that when a student is in a happier or more welcoming environment tend to do better on tests, quizzes, and homework than children who are in an unhappy environment studying. If we take the student who is good at their sport and make them quit the team just because they have a bad grade, then we would be making a bad environment for the people who want the team to win and succeed, and that would affect how they learned and studied. This would not be good for the schools' public image because every school wants to look good. If we start to make our school look very bad just because a sports team lost which they thought would win but didn't, that might make many of our students feel bad and a bit disappointed.

When a student is put through an online course at home, the easiness to make friends and interact with people goes away. In fact, home schooled kids have shown a lack of social skills, and are generally more shy than those who go to public school.

Several schools have began online learning since the corona outbreak started to try and reduce the spread of that highly infectious disease. Another big social benefit, would be that kids can't be disruptive during classes and talk when the teacher is talking or talking to other kids and disrupt their learning envierment. Online learning would fix many have the social problems we have at school today.

B9871E7972A3,"Conclusion.Some kids who enjoy a concept, or just want to learn as much information about something as possible, are limited to how much the teach talks about it. With online learning students can explore the internet and other sources to find all sorts of information on a topic. In classrooms, teachers have a teaching method they use and just have to hope it works for everybody. In online learning, there is several ways of learning like watching a video, reading notes, and using a review game. Online learning would allow students to use each method and whatever they think helps them best they can use.

BC0D8223C604,"Concluding Statement.It is at time, at last, to conclude all the disadvantages of the Electoral College in one, it's ominous due to the fact that the public votes not for the president, but for a state of electors, disvalues ones' citizenship rights and influences' the country of not voting. The opression against the Electoral College, has it's witty motives. As we all know, the most popular partys are the Republic and Democrat. If the Electoral College, only selects one state out of the entire nation, that allows one states, that carries one culture of people to form the regimen of the rules of that successful party. No goverment, should suit this fashion, because it isn't right in any shape or form. ",1,0,122

BC73CEB66875,Conclusion.Mainly because alot of the states donot even see an ad for the presidential campaign. Also because it is not winner takes all like it is for most states.

BF0241C10324,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion, changing the policy to participate in sports and other activities to having an average grade of a B instead of a C should be done.

This would require students to have to focus on the purpose of school, learning, before anything else.

Also, if students have a grade of a C, then they should have to spend the time they would use for sports or other activities to raise their grade.

Finally, being able to participate in sports and other activities should be a reward for working hard and receiving good grades.

As you can see, this is a policy change that should be made, as the opportunity to play sports and partake in other extra-curricular activities should be earned, not given. ",1,2,126

It would simply not be fair if our small states had the same amout of power as our larger states. California has more of a population, therefore should have more say in Congress, than New Jersey. ''Your states entitles allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation; one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators.'' Just the way this is set up in Congress, the same amount of power for each state is applied for choosing our President for the next four years.

Every four years, nearly every person in America will vote to choose a new President, or do we? Yes, we live in a democracy where we can vote for who runs out country, but do we really make the descision? The Electoral College is a phase where electors, of a candidate running for president, come together and decide for who is the President, Vice President, and include the countings of the electoral votes from Congress. The person who runs for President has a select group of people known as electors, which are typically chosen by that person's political party ",4,2,118

In ""Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" it says that ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."", meaning that we don't choose for ourselves, they do.

As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" With the government concerned about the safety of a driver behind the wheel, they will not allow driverless cars on the roads. The safety of the people is more important than to advancement of technology. Until the driverless cars have been updated to the time where they are safe for everyone, there is no way that driverless cars will be seen on the roads with regular cars for quite some time. This is why driverless vehicles are against the law in some states. ",3,2,125
C4804C3EEBD7,"Conclusion.because there could be problems over the outcome of an Electoral College, the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. A candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. Voters in toss-up are more likely to pay close intention to the campaign, knowing that they are going to decide the election. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the vote cast. It also restores some weight in the political balance. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. The Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. ",3,1,147
C48AEB2F1FC2,"Conclusion.democrats in texas, for example, or republicans in california. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign thn they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. But of course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about 1/2 the eligible american population did vote in 2012's election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think a single vote may decide an entire election. ",3,0,91

C492123F426E,"Conclusion.Driverless cars were always thought to be a thing of the past, but the reality is that they are a thing of the present and have been for many years. The writing points out that, "" Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009."" (Paragraph 2). While many people view driverless cars as a thing of the future, Google has formed them to be a thing of the now. This technology, that has been sought after for generations, is now readaly available. It was even said that Tesla has released plans to come out with a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time in 2016. (Paragraph 10). Knowing that these cars are being released this year is over the top of many peoples head, and shows that the development of these cars is indeed helpful. Knowing that the technology is already out in the world shows that the development of these cars grow every single day. This growth will positivly effect the automotive industry, and keep the people making these cars coming out with new and safe versions of these driverless cars. ",3,2,193
C492123F426E,"Conclusion.This safety is both for the environment, and most importantly for the drivers of these cars. Indeed, these cars are as safe as they ever will be. We are reminded of the safety of these cars when paragraph eight reminds us that, ""In this way, the in-car system is actually a saftey feature, and saftey is a big concern,"" Not only is the in-car heads-up display a safty feature as it talks about, but reminds us that saftey is the biggest concern that the companies have. This paragraph even mentions how some of the ""fun"" features are for the saftey of the driver, mainly to keep them awake and alert at the wheel even if they are not the drivers. Knowing that saftey is one of the bigest concerns that the companies have for these cars sould be settling because consumers know that the automated cars that they buy would be in top conditions and have a multitude of features that keep both themselves and the passangers safe. One of the many features mentioned was the voice or even a vibrating chair to signal when the car needs a human to control the driving because the road needs the expertise of a human driver. Because these cars are safe, their development is very positive. ",3,2,216

So as a result, students stop doing their work. Whereas in a school building, students are not always looking at screens but white boards also which is less harmful to the eyes. Students are not lazy because classes ring from bell to bell, so students are always up and moving rather that sitting behind a computer all day. It's best to go to school without being lazy and staying healthy rather than using a video conference to learn. ",3,2,162

Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Let us going back in time to see how did get here. During revolutionary war in United State of American. Some british had education, but there was not school at the time. Being able to give education for students it was home. And this was for colonies teaching them in group how they can introduce by themeselves and understand command they are given. Late in 1800s to 1900s system changed by government of the time because it began to underatand how education was imporatant to the people. It began to build some classes, so people will not struggle for taking class at home or under the trees. The challenge was not is because the main points was money and people need to do this governement used one idea to increase tax for everything in able to finish the plan. That is how classes have been found. Time of technologies a rise was in middle of 1950s were people began to use new material like box computer and other stuff.

Students must think about the consequences of their own mistakes. Just like many famous people today who act in movies and on television, they also had to work hard.

In a popular vote without the barrier of the Electoral College, all those votes would flow into the pile for whichever canidate they voted for.

CC4EEADA5262,"Conclusion.A lot of other issues should be viewed as more urgent to take care of, than the development of cars that do not need people behind the wheel and in control. They will only cause problems, because they can easily get into accidents, among many other issues. It was just spoken about this week in the news: Google's car got into its first accident. ",3,1,65
CC4EEADA5262,"Conclusion.Many of the driverless cars that the article states have been developed have needed specific conditions in order to function correctly, such as ""a special test track"" or ""magnets with alternating polarity."" How would those cars function in an everyday situation out on the open road? Not very well. So how would they be able to develop a vehicle that can operate on a true highway, as well as on the many other types of roadways in the world? ",3,0,81

CC5894978F31,"Conclusion.The Electoral College is a cruel, pointless process that simply makes a percentage of votes, or all of them if you look at it that way, to mean nothing, and allows for circumstances like the 2000 election. ",5,2,38
CC5894978F31,"Conclusion.What Is the Electoral College?"" states you are voting for electors when you vote, but what is the point if they can simply defy you? It would be like if after the president was chosen, the Senate could overule him with a 1/5 vote. There is also the point in Plumer's article about the time Hawaii sent two slates, which forced the desicion to Nixon, who had to validate only the opponet's votes in fear of otherwise receiving bad publicity. There is also the strange way of resolving a tie, which boils down to the same thing as the winner-take-all system, except if more people support  it doesn't matter. It would be like if everybody in the  room wasn't alowed to vote, other than one voted, but everybody in the room agreed anyway for some strange, miraculous reason. (Of course, the one guy in the  next room doesn't agree, and completely takes out your vote, regardless of the fact that there were 30 people in this one.) ",3,2,170
CC5894978F31,"Conclusion.everything to do with what is wrong with this winner-take-all system, being the 2000 election. ",6,2,16
CC5894978F31,"Concluding Statement.Thus, the Electoral College is completely unfair to voters, and should be abolished. Voters should not have to vote for other votes which could very well defy their's, why not just have the Electoral Cllege do all the voting then? It is both redundant and unfair.    ",1,2,48
CC787397F33B,Conclusion.This means an elector with similar beliefs to the citizens will be chosen and most likely decide their vote in consideration of popular demand. Each state is given representatives in proportion to the poulation of the state. These people can be anyone who does not work in office and maybe a regular American who is probably going to emathize with the needs of the public and if chosen correctly will stand by the option of the state. Electoral College gives a more concentrated form of voting. ,3,2,87
CC787397F33B,"Conclusion.In addition, some may argue that the Electoral College is risky and a representative may not always stay true to their word, but isn't this the case with all types of voting? ",2,2,33
CC787397F33B,Conclusion.A presidential candidate makes many a promise during their race for Chief Executive and there is no way to be completely certain that these oaths will hold true. The same goes for the Electoral College. Citizens must have faith in the candidate as they would in the presidential election that they will put their country or state before personal wants and carry out their responsibilities honestly. The Electoral College process requires trust like any other form of election. ,6,2,79

CF43485AE351,"Conclusion.Visualize this: a student has been suffering for months on end from depression. Every day, he is hesitant to attend school, as he knows the stressful environment exacerbates the symptoms of his depression. When he speaks to his principal about taking time off from school, his principal presents an even better solution: taking classes from home. As soon as the student begins his classes online, he notices a shift in his mental health. He actually enjoys learning. This is only one example of the benefits classes online could present ",4,2,90

CF43485AE351,"Conclusion.However, there is no way for them to remain home and keep up with schoolwork. This fear of being unable to attend school and still keeping up with their course load is one that plagues many students. Personally speaking, I can reference numerous students who have felt dangerously ill on school days, but were so afraid of missing tests and presentations that they still came. They felt that if they even missed one day, they would have missed salient lessons, causing their work to pile up, resulting in stress. Providing an alternate method for these students to learn, such as online classes, would have mitigated their concerns. This logic pertains to mental health as well. It is common knowledge that the mental health of adolescents in this generation is declining, and the most prominent reason is school. Online classes provide an avenue for students who feel their mental health is worsening to still receive an education but from a place of comfort, which is their home. ",3,2,167

CFA59480F8C5,"Conclusion.One method of chosing a President is having an electoral college here in the U.S.A.  That means, the people vote for a group of electors. Not the candidate running for President. In that group they count in the votes and elect witch candidate would win. ",4,1,48

D0DF7AB8B493,"Conclusion.The Electoral vote consists of 538 electors. The most votes that are needed for being elected for president are 270 votes. Each candidate running for president has his own group of electors. The are generally chisen by the candidate political party so is fare. So Im sure that you are going to consider this and read it because some people dont thhink about it. Some dont know how it works and vote for a new one because it sound better but is not.

I just want to make sure people are inform with. That they read this and tthink about it. This is only held every 4 years on the tuesday after the first monday of november. So you might not want to make a big mistake making this decision. People might think that this is not that big of a deal but it is. This very important for the president and the government.

D176ABB06812,"Concluding Statement.The number of cons seems to outweigh the pros. Safety is always a big issue to everyone because it is important that everyone is safe at all times. As the world progresses money seems to be more of an issue. Driverless cars are seemingly too expensive to buy in the first place, let alone the price of gas being a taxi service. The convienience of a taxi is always so pleasant until they are unneccisary, like in smaller areas. Personally, the driverless cars just seem to have too many negative qualities to be worth production. ",1,0,97
D1ACADAC5ED4,"Conclusion.Many students come into school even if they are sick. This causes an illness to spread around the entire student body just because one student couldn't miss class. On the other hand, if a student stays home because they are sick, they miss a lot of classwork and aren't able to pay attend the important lessons being taught. One time, I had to stay home because of a stomach bug. I got behind in my classes and was never really able to understand the concepts as well as I could have if I was taught by my teacher like everyone else. I got a very bad grade on the test on these concepts because I was not able to catch up. If I was able to call in to my missed classes, I would have benefited greatly because I could ask questions if I had any, hear the teacher's explanation, and see how the teacher would solve the problem instead of having to figure it all out on my own. On a more serious level, there are some kids who are, unfortunately, terminally ill. They are either physically unable to go to school because of their type of illness or aren't allowed to go out very often because of the risks and dangers they could face. They are more prone to your typical cold and flu, and it is deadlier for them. If they were able to sit in on their classes through a video conference, then they could still feel like they are going to high school like a ""normal"" teenager. Overall, even if attending classes online was only available to those who are sick, it would still help so many kids. ",3,2,284

So basically if a said law is broken then the human gets the bad end of the deal, but if its a driverless car who will get the blame for a traffic law being broken the company that made it or the owner of the driverless car? Also in paprgraph 7 it basically said the car can drive its self unless if it needs human help and that the driver must always has his or her hands on the wheel. Basically saying we are able to regain control if needed, but what if we couldn't because the car is acting up and then we get injured or get others hurt. ",3,0,153

There are some teachers that pretty much just give out homework and that would ruin there whole school year curriculum. ,3,1,76
D30490AE8641,Concluding Statement.Truthfully who wants to do more work than they already have to do. In my opinion school work is very hard without knowing you will have to go home knowing that after working all day at school the students just have to go home and work more. ,1,0,49

DB9CAE4A0E72,"Conclusion.In today's society, things are growing and changing at a rapid rate. There are new technological advances and new ideas and innovations that come into this world everyday. One particular subject that comes in mind is the idea of online courses. These courses are mainly for people who do not have easier access or any type of transportation to school which can lead to be very useful. People love this idea and innovation of school and think students could genuinely benefit from this. Undoubtedly, there are a lot of flaws to this, the one major problem that stands out the most is it could cause students to take advantage of these online courses and cheat by using another browser to look up their answer's and could lead to long-term consequences. ",4,2,131
DB9CAE4A0E72,"Conclusion.For instance, I have gone to school from a laptop and in person and having the teachers there in person is a very different experience to have than from learning off of a laptop. Because not only does it show that the teachers care, but it makes the students feel like they are really engaged in the activity and makes it more fun to learn. Teachers set the rule for students and sometimes show them the difference between right and wrong. They also sometimes have students engage in fun activities as for another way to learn. Instead of being taught through a screen, people that have teachers in person help students understand what they are trying to learn and can engage in one-on-one conversations in person. ",3,2,127
DB9CAE4A0E72,"Conclusion.Unlike online courses, teachers can observe students during their classwork and exam to see if they are cheating or not. For example, a teacher can watch you in person and closely, but the teacher through the screen can only see what you show and not your full body as in person. This shows that cheating could be a major key flaw to online courses and shows that it does not very well help a student learn or understand in any way possible. In fact, it does the opposite of that. Undoubtedly, online courses are subject to very likely cheating and does not prepare students for any type of further learning after high schoo ",3,0,114
DB9CAE4A0E72,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion, online course do not benefit students because gaining an in-person experience with teachers can help a student learn better from their mistakes on certain types of questions. They also do not benefit students by having more of a likely chance to cheat during exams online. Because of this, this does not prepare students for further growth of knowledge if they want to continue to do school after high school. The final reason students do not benefit from online courses is that students need friends in person because that is what makes them have a good childhood and become a better person based of off their opinions. To conclude, online courses are not a way to help students at all during this day and age. It has too many flaws that can not be fixed unfortunately. A lot of things are growing in this society, but this should not grow any further. ",1,2,155

DD586A625C89,"Conclusion.We all know that this is already a big problem here. If the new rule is made, the no cell phone rule wont get any 'better'. In fact, the problem will just slowly get worse until texting in class gets out of hand. If cell phones are allowed in school just during lunch, it could be in one kid's mind thinking, ""If its allowed at lunch, then the teacher wont be so strict on texting in class."" Once one kid starts flipping out the cell phone in class, other people will catch on and turn on their mobile devices too. In a matter of months, it could lead to more detentions, more suspensions, and more angry parents. So think, what is the positive of having cell phones even at lunch? ",3,2,132
DD586A625C89,"Conclusion.Another reason why cell phones shouldn't even be allowed is the lingering question, ""Why do kids need to text in school when their friends are there?"" ",0,2,28

Perhaps because sometimes the electors get to thinking in another midset and vote for the wrong candidate...Yes that is poosible. When people vote for there candidate the electors are the ones being selected and aren't always the way they were in their chosing so therefore there can be a serious tip in votes if the electors don't vote for the candidate of the party they were selected by.

The voting process should depend on the voice of the people, but with the electoral college, some of these voices have been taken.    ",1,0,46
E09853233CCF,"Conclusion.First, there really is no way of cheating in the popular vote method because people vote once for whom ever they want to be president out of the people elected and then the president is chosen that way. The popular votes method is more fair because candidates spend a little time in every if not majority of the states, depending on how much time they have. But as stated in the article written by Bradford Plumer in the electoral college voting method ""candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" That is not fair every state should be able to see the candidates who are going to be serving the country and see what they are like and how they can help the country. And this has happened before where the candidates didn't even bother showing up in some of the states. One example would be as stated in the article By Bradford Plumer ""during the 2000 campaign, seventeeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Now how on earth can people vote for their new president if they have absoloutley no idea of what the president is capable of doing to help or even hurt the country. ",3,0,240
E0A3FC64B7D3,"Conclusion.The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Our state's entitled allotmeant of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for our Senators.

Each candidate running for President in our state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidiate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. Most states have a ""Winner-take-all

"" system that awards al electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of ""proportional representation.""

What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the President, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the President. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central commitee, sometimes the Presidential candidates themselves. The single best argument against the electoral college is what they might call the disaster factor. Perhaps most worrying is the prospct of a tie in the electoral vote. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters.

The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anarchronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a President and ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense. It is the electors who elect the the President, nort the people. When you vote for a Presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Yet this has happened very rarely. It happend in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888. There are 5

reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of Democratic pedigree

E0CD80A39381,"Conclusion.This is crutial because ""a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president"" (Posner).  With the Electoral College in place it makes it impossible to for a candidate with only regional appeal to become president because no region has enough electoral votes to elect them ",3,2,50
E0CD80A39381,"Conclusion.It is less likely for disputes because ""the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"" (Posner).  Even if a state has a few more votes for the Electoral College it still creates a huge victory.  ",3,2,44

E0FAD617D3BF,"Concluding Statement.Having popular votes system will be arguably the best system to use for the election and towards the voting process. Using electoral votes will be unfair to voters when they are voting because of the simply winner-take-all basis of each and every one of the fifty states. Not only that it's unfair, it also causes many crisis in the United States dealing with this system alone and then eventually lead to dramatic chaos across the nation. Also, having the amount of electoral votes doesn't compare to the population of the actual state. Remember it is still one representative for the 500,000 people in Wyoming. Popular votes should be used in every political system no matter what situation it is. As the passage says, the argument against direct elections are spuriors at the best. ",1,2,136

Posner goes on to tell us how many times the trust has been betrayed... the most recent being in the election year 2000 and then the only other time the electoral vote did not reflect the popular vote was 1888.

Because Generic_Name was a trouble maker at school, her parents thought that public school was not the best place for her to receive an education. Therefore, Generic_Name took online classes at home. Online classes tend to be a very tedious and a independent responsibility that requires a ton of focus and self-control. Generic_Name did not have these qualities. Because Generic_Name took online classes from home and obtained the qualities of having no focus and no self control, she did not take her online classes as seriously as she needed to. During the times that Generic_Name was supposed to be focused with her online circular, she was more focused on boys and going out to parties. Distance learning was not beneficial to Generic_Name because she was too irresponsible to have such a tremendous responsibility that she was supposed to hold her accountable for. ",3,2,160

When there is a Run-off Election, the House Of Representatives picks the president. I personally think this is a good thing because they picked the person who would do best in the job by gathering everyone's vote to decide it. Because no country could have two presidents with two vice presidents. ",3,0,86

Either way, you are going to help out the community in a positive way. ",3,2,84

E73329DA93D6,Conclusion.My final reason is it works good. ,0,0,8
E740029E13D1,Concluding Statement.All in all the Electoral College is just the better method of voting. The Electoral College will give what the people want. Also the electoral college  represents the states votes. The reason is because electoral colleges are game changers and a trust worthy method. Certainly it wll be easier to choose a president and break ties.    ,1,2,58

E85C45D90D1D,"Conclusion.Lastly, the school environment is made for learning. Classrooms have helpful posters and worksheets that guide students in their learning. The walls are usually soundproofed, and teachers help to prevent distractions. This setup is in direct contrast to a home environment. Also, being present in the classroom helps to prevent technology malfunctions and poor connection that could be disruptive or deteriorate the student's ability to learn. ",3,2,67

E862C9EC5EC5,"Conclusion.Just imagine if on every single issue every single person would have to vote on the outcome to pass anything would take such a long time. Including the elections, the electoral college makes a short sweet way for voting, the population votes and then they vote for what we voted for (most of the time...) ",3,0,57
E87BDAB97148,Conclusion.The reason why people would most likely not want to change it because they might like voting for an elector and because they might think it is much easier and wont take as long to choose the president. ,2,0,39
E87BDAB97148,"Conclusion.And so the dont spend time in the states because they know they have no chance in winning. And the state might pick a elector that they do not like by accident and mess up their vote. And the electors can only be people not holding public office. They might also choose a certain president because of his or her race.

And the thing is that the people do not choose the president the electors elect the president. Sometimes but it hardly ever happens, the elector chosen would change their vote to the other president. It depends on the state on who would most likely become president because the more people the bigger the vote will be. Also the electoral college method might turn of certain voters. And sometimes no candidate wins the majority vote and this causes pressure and makes it complicated to elect the president.    ",3,1,148
E899EF61626A,"Conclusion.To begin with, I strongly believe state senator should change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States because Electoral College is unfair to voters. ",0,2,30
E899EF61626A,"Conclusion.Secondly, I strongly believe state senator should change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States because it can cause problems in your state. ",0,2,29
E899EF61626A,"Conclusion.Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors. Statisics show that Congress would get 34 electoral votes but they aren't really voting for the president. For Instance, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. That many voters vote on one party for president and another for Congress. ",3,0,74

E9938C48F7AB,"Conclusion.Also a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. your states entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its congressional delegation. Plus, each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. So this would be perfect for everyone to vote. 
",3,1,55
E9938C48F7AB,"Conclusion.After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ' certificate of Ascertainment' listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of theelectors in december of the election year. Your states certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the congress and the national Archives as part of the offical records of the presidential election. ",3,1,89

People that go to Mars have to be very brave and other things too. the camera has taken pictures because it has to have proof that it really does look like a face. I think again that it is just a landform that has been made over the pass years by the gratational pull and Earths winds.       ,1,0,74

EA5BFD706570,"Conclusion.The topic of online learning is very controversial. Many schools offer online services to accommodate those who vary in schedules, need more time for assignments and comprehension, or even those who just work better alone. Now a days, schools are becoming more diverse in terms of the variation in which a student can learn. There are both current benefits and future benefits to online learning. ",4,0,66
EA5BFD706570,"Concluding Statement.Online schooling truly depends on the person at hand. What works for one person doesn't always work for another. Online school promotes both current and future benefits, as does public schools. There is no say in which one is better or worse. As individuals we are all different and possess different traits and qualities. With so many individuals in the world, it's important that we accommodate all people. A person may strive in one situation but stress in another. This means that online schooling should remain an option for students and families. ",1,2,94

However, humans aren't too far off from making these gadgets a reality. In particular, research and many tests concerning driverless cars have been happening for quite some time now. It gets people wondering though; does the development of these driverless cars reap more benefits than negatives? ",4,2,73
EB16CD7EC3E6,"Concluding Statement.the development of the driverless car has come very far in the very short time that it's been around. It's already allowed for a safer experience with automated brakes, multiple sensors, and notifications to the driver when something is wrong. With even further development than what we have already, safety could eventually not be a concern at all. With that being developed, so too are ways in efficiency and cost of transportation. By being for the development of driverless cars, so many significant benefits could be here in the years to come. ",1,2,94

EB935594E696,"Conclusion.the presidental election is realized every four years after the first monday of November. When the presidental election is done the governor of each state has to prepare a Certificate of Arcertainment how the Federal Register says. Not only keep the electoral college allow to vote just for their president , they also when they are voting for their president they are voting for their electoral. ",3,0,66

EBD070DAE867,"Conclusion.As technology continues to advance, cars are seeing advancements in safety and driving capabilities that go further than what the driver can do. Cars the can sense when the car needs to break if the driver is distracted. Brakes that are anti-lock which means they distribute different amounts of braking pressure to wheels that may have more traction to prevent loss of control. ",4,0,64

EBD070DAE867,"Conclusion.If the driver has to sit at ready all the time then how is it a driverless car? As a driver, I know what I am capable of and I feel best when I am driving and I am in control. It would take a whole lot of trust for me to just turn my car on autopilot and let it take over considering there are many things that can happen while you are driving down the road. Many questions come up, such as, Will the car react in time? Will the technology even know to react? Will the car safely and controllably avoid whatever obsticle is thrown it's way. All these things change if the driver is sitting back not driving because the car apparently can do it all by itself.

Eventually, in the future, it is very possible to see cars with an autopilot function or other self-driving techniques but we are a long way from cars driving without human help. ",3,0,164

EBF9131A638F,"Conclusion.Students who do get on are on task and on point. The students who get on the computer and get on the online class for a short period of time at home might be playing, or might not be concentrated, because he is at home and dosen't feel like doing it.

You get tired and worn out when you do a lot. You just have to suck it up and deal with it, it's a part of being a real athlete. Some people aren't cut out to be a athlete. It's a lot of work, if you want to be good. Some kids play all sports, that come in a regular season. It's hard, but they do it. Some people don't understand all the stuff athletes have to deal with and go through, its hard work. If you do it you are apart of the team and you can't quit.

And the government is already slowly demolishing our freedoms to save the little fishies that swim in gutters. They live on algae and stuff so why ban phosphates in dishwasher detergent, or get rid of mercury in light bulbs and have the green light bulbs which shine too bright or too dull.

One way that school systems have attempted to avoid set backs in education during this time has been the use of online education resources.

Even students that were invested in an after school activity before a switch to online schooling occurred would face the difficulty in their ability to travel to the new meeting place of their activity. Many students do not have access to a car, either for financial or legal reasons (they do not have a license yet), so busing is the only way these students are able to travel to and from the school. With online schooling this busing would no longer be consistent and many after school activities would see huge drops in participation or fold entirely. This would be detrimental to the students who any have the talents to successes in other activities outside of the school.

F15EC33EC261,"Conclusion.because the electoral college is a process not a place. The founding father established it in the constitition as the compromise between election of the President by a popular vote. The electoral college cobsists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Your state's entitles allotment of electors equals the number of members in its congressional delegation: one for each memeber in the house of representatives plus two for your senators. Each candiate running for president in your state has hin or her own group of electors. The Electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.

The presidential election is held every four years on the tuesday after the first monday in november. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President  because when you vote for your candidate  you actually voting for your candidate's electors. After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ""Certifacte of Ascertainent"" lsiting all of the candidates  who ran for president in your state along  with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state  at the meeting of the electors in december of the election year. Your state's certificates of acertainments are sent to the congres and the national archives as part of the official records of the presential election.

Under the electoral college system, voters not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president. if you lived in texas, for example, and and wanted to vote for john kerry, you'd vote for a slate of democatic  electors pledged to kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can anyone not holding public office it depends on the state. That is how it works this is my reason.    ",3,1,346

The part that gets a lot of people is that there could be fewer Republican electors then there are Democrat electors. Say one still wanted the Republican candidate to win and they voted in their residential state which was Nevada. IF Nevada had 4 Republican electors then that meant anyone who voted for the Democrat electoral wasn't chipping in much to the election. In the end, all the electors votes are counted for each side, and because Nevada had only two dedicated Democrats, the chances of the Democrat candidate having less electoral votes then the Republican candidate, has increased.

F6F4D85648D6,"Conclusion.When using the Electoral College you have an exact percentage of the outcome of the votes, no guessing or estamating. The Electoral College has a method of awarding electoral votes, inducucing the candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states. This is because voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, making it easier for the candidates to study what the certain states needs are and convincing them that if they vote for them, their needs will be met.

I'm sure many people in those sates such as South Carolina and Rhode Island had a lot of input to add in the 2000 campagin but because they were little minority states they werent focused on as much as the other larger staes. This is very unfair and judgementally to these states because the Electoral College is based on involuntary effects, the inhabitants of North Caiolina or Rhode Island cannot control where they choose to live, they might have to live in the certain geograpic location because of finaces or religous persecution. They may want to have a say in the election but cant because of their living arrangements. ",3,2,142

F8FB4470A52F,"Conclusion.The Office of the Federal Register explains, ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress"" (The Office of the Federal Register 1). This adds suppprt that at the end of the election, almost every part of an election including votes, is taken into consideration, thus making the election a sucessful one. ",3,0,77
F8FB4470A52F,"Conclusion.This is reliterated when The Office of the Federal Register statees, "" Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional Delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators...(Office of the Federal Register 1). In addition this means that each state will receive an opportunity to have a meaningful vote to the elections because every state has the same kinds of members being awareded to them. Each state will have a different number of members due to the size, but they will all be of equal value to the canidates. To add for support, Posner says, ""No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president""(Posner 1). With this, all the states understand that their vote is crucial to the election and the canidates. Fortunately, the Electoral College is fair and equal to all the state's voting in the election, sometimes even more than some states know. For example, Posner states, "" Voters in toss up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign-to really listen tp the competing candidates-knowing that they are going to decide the election""(Posner 1).  Ultimately, the Electoral College is the most fair way to decide and vote for a future president who will be our leader of all the citizens.

FA49F4D9E6A8,"Conclusion.The majority of kids that are home schooled or take online classes are because of what goes on around them at school. Kids may not feel comfortable, not being able to get along with the people around them, and having trouble learning. Kids may find online classes a better way of education by concentrating and focusing more, rather than being distracted by other things around them at school such as kids disturbing them and the drama that goes on between students. ",3,2,82
FA49F4D9E6A8,Conclusion.Another example on why kids may be taking online classes are because of what goes on in their life. Kids my age on social media that are influences are busy with the media . They create content or focus on other things in life that may not fit with a full schedule class at school so they choose to take online classes that way they learn on their own time and have time to work on their social media life ,3,2,80
FA49F4D9E6A8,"Conclusion.Lastly, failing a class. In some situations, students end up failing a class or classes and end up having to retake these classes online. Also, online classes is a great idea because it could help prepare students for college. Some students in college take online classes and do most of their work online, which will help the students that are still in school get prepared for college. ",3,2,68

""Voters are the people who want to express rather than people who think a single vote will decide.""

they're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election to the kind we have now.

FBE13E9A446C,"Conclusion.but just because the possibility is low does not mean you can simply allow the flaws in the voting system to exist. A small hole in a fabric can only grow bigger, and the same goes for our electoral college. ",6,2,41
FBE13E9A446C,"Conclusion.If one wanted to, an elector can completely disregard the decision of the voters and choose who they want. Considering the ratio of electors in some states to people, it seems completely non-democratic for the votes of some to be more important than the wants of the common people. Some start to feel that they shouldn't vote because their one vote wouldn't have the power to change anything, and wouldn't even ensure the election of the president they want. Another thing that lowers the morale is the absence of candidates in states that can't be won very easily. If a candidate is pretty sure he can't win over a state, he won't visit it because it wouldn't be worth his time. He also wil prioritize large states over small ones because they have more electoral votes. All of these can make a state or person feel as if the election isn't really in their hands, and when people feel like their vote doesn't matter, they don't vote. ",3,2,168
FBE13E9A446C,"Concluding Statement.The Electoral College may be functional, but is largely inefficient and is not in the best interest of the common people. The vote for a candidate is not even in the hands in the people, but rather a minority of chosen electors. In a country that prides itself on the power the people have, and the control they have on how their country is run, the people have surprisingly less influence than you would think. We as a people need to speak up against the overrated system that is the Electoral College, and develop a system that fits the needs of a true democracy like America should be.   ",1,2,110

007E0CBA8852,Conclusion.Talking to someone to get an outside opinion could help because this person doesn't know all parts of the story or maybe doesn't know everybody involved personally. This is helpful because they have no sense of bias on who is involved and what is happening in the situation. This person isn't going to sugar coat their words and tell you the truth even if it's something that you don't want to hear. They may simply listen to what you have to say and will already be ready to introduce to you new opinions and will help you look at it from a different perspective. They may tell us the truth to address the things we may be avoiding in the situation such as something that is right or wrong. This helps us because sometimes we need to hear the truth to see why we are right or wrong in these situations. By hearing the truth and possibly getting advice to move forward you get to move forward with all your facts laid out. ,3,2,174
007E0CBA8852,"Concluding Statement.Different people that are helpful to seek advice from is someone who is more of an outside opinion because they tell you the truth and dont sugar coat their thoughts. If you seek someone who has a different mindset they will introduce new ways of thinking and different approaches you could take in the situation.

By expressing all your feelings, thoughts, and emotions you are letting someone know how you feel and getting the support you need to move forward confidently. By talking to multiple people exploring new thoughts and mindsets, getting an unbiased opinion, and being able to express and organize your thoughts you are getting set up to make good choices rationally. I personally believe that when someone asks multiple people for advice it and seeking multiple opinions it helps them be able to make smart and rational choices while being confident with their choice and content with their thoughts and emotions.  ",1,2,156

09537221A5ED,"Conclusion.Many people at my age are like the thirsty sprinting towards poisoned water. It is terrible for them, but they are so in need that they drink it anyway, hoping for a miracle. People tend to have knee-jerk reactions, sometimes leading in the wrong direction. This is caused by the frontal lobe, the part of the brain that is used in decision making and long-term planning, is not fully developed until age 25. This means that minors tend to turn to the ""gut reaction"" part of their brain for major and minor decisions, usually strongly influenced by what their friends are doing, just to fit in. This can lead them to make stupid decisions that they later will regret. Turning to other influences to help make a decision can help avoid these unfortunate dispositions. ",3,2,135

Other people have often been through a similar scenario and have gained knowledge from past experiences to help guide us in the right direction.

For all these reasons and more, we must seek multiple opinions to make a better choice. ",1,0,78

0959BDBD0FB4,"Conclusion.It is good to have a variety in past experiences because they can help you make an educated decisions for the present but also for the future. When you chose what experiences to go for, you should choose ones that are close to your present experiences but also for the future experiences you will go through. You should also have some experiences from the other side to siphon through the bias of the other experiences. This will help you to make an educated decision for the present but also for the future. ",3,2,93
0959BDBD0FB4,"Concluding Statement.To sum up, I have found that when I need advice it's helpful to go to ask multiple people for their opinions rather than just one.

In conclusion, When ever you need advice going to multiple people is the best way to go.  ",1,0,73

Also asking various people can help rule out the advice that wasn't meant to help you given by the people who don't actually want you to succeed or be happy.

0C06B988433C,"Conclusion.Education is one of the fundamental pillars of a successful democracy and harmonious society. As such, it is of the utmost importance that America's education system be of the highest quality in order to foster the development of intelligent citizens. With the rapid advancement of new technology has come opportunities for new ways to learn; students can type rather than hand write, access internet databases for information, and work collaboratively online rather than in person, among other advantages. It is easy to believe that all the aspects of technology that have been introduced to schools have positively impacted student performances, but an outlier is online learning. ",4,2,107
0C06B988433C,"Concluding Statement.Enabling the use of online classes detracts from students' learning experiences and academic success. A class taken online is one not fully engaged in by students. It is educators' responsibility, however, rather than students, to ensure that dishonest conduct does not take place and that students are engaged in their learning. The best way to ensure these things is to demand that learning take place in a school rather than through the internet.  ",1,2,75

0C82FD59BA0B,"Concluding Statement.Due to the lack of a teacher presence and of participation in a classroom, I believe that teens would not benefit from receiving education from home. Without a teacher, who has been trained for years, a student cannot focus on his or her work, and can fall behind other teens who are the same age. And without a personal experience in a classroom, students who take online classes won't be able to learn from mistakes or interact and gain feedback from teachers and peers.

Advice has many interpretations but to me advice is, asking someone their opinion on how you should do something. This could mean how a person should run a new business or what type of dog food they could buy. One reason I believe advice is so important is because whether you use the advice or not, you still gain knowledge and understanding of that person's point of view.

Communication is something in life you will use quite frequently, and I recommend attempting to master, because it can make someone's day in a heart beat if you use opinionated conversations the right way. You can even spark a pleasant conversation with your neighbor by asking them about football if they are big football fans, especially if you both like the same team. A specific opinion is needed here as well because you might have learned in the past that your neighbor does not like to talk about politics or the media, this is why you need to learn boundaries.

1590FD8BEA8E,"Conclusion.This is highly beneficial as one could hear advice that they would not have even thought of. Different answers derive from one's cultural background. One example would be medicine itself. In the 17th century, diseases ran rampant, especially smallpox, as there was no method of combating the virus. Europe had no cure for smallpox, and a large percent of Europe's population passed, as well as the American Indians later, who lost 50 to 90 percent of their population due to the disease. Many years of trying to find a cure for this disease failed, even when all of Europe was trying. However, a European came back from Asia (most likely China) with knowledge of inoculation. China and parts of Asia had suffered from the Bubonic Plague, and created inoculation, which today is known as vaccination. One received a small amount of the virus so one's immune system learned to fight it. This method of disease prevention was widely used in England, then in the rest of Europe. Because of the advice from another side of the world and the widespread use of this ""new cure,"" smallpox and other viral infections were eradicated from Europe. ",3,2,196
15EAD0CC9F3D,"Conclusion.School is indeed an essential part in the development of one's mind and future. However, it's not the perfect solution for everybody, as some people produce a higher performance rate when it comes to learning at home through digital methods. A common reason would be the people who aren't as socially adept in comparison to the others, and encounter some difficulties learning in such a public area filled with a large amount of people. They would usually work better in a more secluded workplace such as their home. I can personally attest to this myself, as I've occasionally resorted to partaking in online conferences, as on occasions, I would have difficulty learning in an area with people I lacked the determination to interact with. This doesn't just only include social aspects though, as even people with poor health, like the common cold or even more detrimental illnesses, will find it very beneficial to learn through virtual means ",3,2,158
15EAD0CC9F3D,"Conclusion.For starters, online courses allow for better understanding between one another, as methods such as video conferencing eliminates the background noises that makes it difficult to for the student to converse with the teacher and vice versa. If video conferencing isn't a preferred method of interaction, one can simply just type out their responses and inquiries they may have to the teacher, which makes it an efficient and clear way of understanding what they're trying to say.

21C75B3F290A,"Concluding Statement.Learning at home helps to block out the other distractions that come with school, making learning a more stress-free, focused, and effective process. With the process of learning becoming more effective, students would be able to learn at unprecedented rates and would be ready to tackle the problems of our world. Because isn't that the whole point of education, and more specifically school? To educate the student and teach them how to learn, so that one day, when the students are making decisions that will not only impact themselves but the whole world, they will be ready and willing to take on these challenges.

22D938F5E0E2,"Conclusion.What is truly important about getting up in the morning and going to a gigantic building filled with hundreds of people is that it is filled with family, friends, neighbors, and even strangers. Meeting all of these people and learning new things about them can really strengthen the school-wide community connections. Advancements with technology also help us by letting students connect with other people in their community, but technology also doesnt help us if we are letting students attend classes online through video conferences. Doing so would cause a major lack of enthusiasm and relationships within a community. Going home independently and working on classwork without getting the chance to learn about your teacher or other classmates through this safe environment at school, causes a total downfall on community awareness. ",3,2,131
22D938F5E0E2,"Conclusion.Almost every kid remembers at least one first day of school memory when they were little or even this past year. Well, that connection you made with other students and your teacher was an official eye-to-eye connection made. Unlike looking at a screen four hours on end while being taught, having the physical opportunity to talk to your teacher either in a whole class discussion or one-on-one is much more effective than an email or text message. There was a study done by the Freelance College in North Dakota, many certified scientist studied the difference between learning through videos on a screen at home or being at school learning through a teacher. Both groups were taught the same thing and took a ten question test on the lesson that the teacher had taught. The statistics showed that students who stayed at home had a test average of 75%, while students who went to school had a test average of 97% The students who worked on the computer at home had a shorter attention span because their teacher was physically not at their house teaching them, thus caused the at home students to do poorly on the test. Overall, this study clearly shows that students learn exceptionally better with eye-to-eye discussion in real life at school. Being able to communicate with a teacher one-on-one or in a class discussion really makes a positive change in the students academic performance. ",3,2,239

242E9BA55C0C,"Concluding Statement.Distance learning is an exciting and innovative form of learning that is being put into place around the world. Through the use of online lessons and videos, students who do not have access to traditional schools are given a chance to learn. Distance learning gives a voice to those who are often overlooked and forgotten, and gives them a way to better themselves and succeed. Though not without it's flaws, distance learning can be very beneficial to students taking classes from home.  ",1,2,84
2446D9BE78B8,"Conclusion.Though it takes time, seeking advice from multiple sources allows for more information and different viewpoints, leading to a better outcome. ",5,2,22
2446D9BE78B8,"Conclusion.They may have learned the information incorrectly, which can lead to bad advice. As an example, lets say a new mother was seeking advice on how to raise their child safely. According to the Family and Consumer Science program, 68% of people under the age of 25 do not have antiquate information on how to perform childcare duties. If that mother were to ask one of her unqualified friends, she could be presented with false information. That friend may of thought they were qualified to give information. A second study performed by Generic_Name shows the less qualified people are, to more they tend to think they are qualified. That could mean you are getting advice from an unreliable source, and most likely your course of action will be worse. ",3,2,130
2446D9BE78B8,"Conclusion.Bias can be hard to detect in many cases, especially when the thing biased to is smaller and less prevalent. Research done by the California Critical Thinking and Development Organization, 72% of people were unable to identify bias in articles. For what seems like such a simple skill, it is surprising in the amount of people who are unable to preform it. Taking to multiple sources makes bias easier to identify, because more conflict will occur in the information. One source may leave out information to angle the evidence, while the other states all the evidence. Even in cases where bias in unavoidable, taking to multiple sources may provide better results. As Generic_Name, a researcher for the University of Oklahoma states, ""Researching biased topics may prove challenging, but combining evidence together to rid the bias is a helpful strategy in reducing the nonfactual information."" ",3,2,146
2446D9BE78B8,"Concluding Statement.As all evidence suggests, taking advice from multiple people is the right course of action to receive the best information. When people only take advice from one person, they allow for many mistakes and mishaps. Next time you are trying to make a decision that will have the best outcome, rather than only asking for advice from one person, take advice from multiple and gather as much information about the topic as possible. The more information you have, the more likely you are to make the correct choice. ",1,2,90
24BC9F21DAE0,"Conclusion.Life can get difficult sometimes, and we might not always know what to do. No one wants to walk into a big decision blind, though. So, what can we do? Most people ask for advice. But just one person's opinion and experience may not be enough. ",4,0,47

25C5C068B05E,Concluding Statement.Overall it is very important and very good to ask people for advice or opinions so that they have an idea about whats happening and it overall just makes them not as stressed and nervous.

If you get multiple people's advice then you will know a lot more about the problem than if you only asked one person. This helps in many fields including the medical field. For example if you have a medical problem but want to know more about it, You usually ask more than one person so that you know everything that you can about what you may have. ",3,2,102
287F79B6D6F6,"Conclusion.After a long and tiring day at school, students often look forward to returning home to retire in a stress-free environment. People's homes remind them that their strenuous day of work has come to an end and that they can now comfortably enjoy their home alongside the company of their family and friends. Students have come to have a negative perception of school as it exhausts their energy and causes them stress. But what happens when they choose to attend their institution from the comfort of their home? Does their home, a prior safe heaven from school, gain a more stressful connotation?

Students can utilize the teachers in the way that school was originally intended without having to wait on a classmate to finish asking a teacher a question or wait till the teacher is finished helping the other students. Since students can learn from their own homes they can eat whenever they would like to and never have to really leave the classroom or stop for a lunch break. The liberty to customize a learning space allows the student to create a space that can be the most preferred and visually appealing to enhance overall brain activity and creativity. ",3,2,150

2A4C1A1AD665,"Conclusion.It is easier to be reassured by multiple people, rather than one, because a group of people is more likely to think of more different ideas, than an individual person. One person may tell somebody that they look good, or they did well at something, just because they wouldn't want to hurt that person's feelings. In contrast, a group of people may agree upon recommendations, or could even help the person, depending on the situation.

They helped me come up with an idea, but the rest was up to me. I then came to ask my older friend, who had done this project before. He helped me come up with how I was going to make it, and display it with confidence to the class. When all was said and done, I got an A on the project. Afterward, I pondered what I did in order to get the good grade. I remembered that I had sought the opinion and ideas of 3 different people, and I had done the very best I could have done.

I explained my situation to many of my friends and they helped me calm down and gave me advice on how to focus and study. Getting advice from many people helped me relieve my stress and do well at the competition. I felt more calm because of the support from my friends after getting advice.

As an example, Generic_Name might not know what to do when the school bully tells him to meet him after school on the blacktop to fight. Generic_Name asks his friend what to do and his friend has the same idea as him. Asking two or three people might give new or maybe even better ideas than the one that he thought of.

A lot of stress people get in there lives is from being without anyone to help them and that could really mess with a person's mind. Most of the times when people do have other people in their lives, they make the right choices. If they do good in school, they will most likely go to college, then they could work and level up to be a manager or have their own business.

When people ask for advice, they tend to ask more than one person because they want to make the better choice for themselves. People who want to make the best choice look for credibility, different ideas, and different views, and they do this by asking many different kinds of people from young to old, people from different countries, and more. They want as much opinions as possible so they can narrow it down to one idea that will help them make the best choice. For example, a student might be researching about the Civil War for their history paper. They might ask their history teacher for ideas because their teacher happens to be history major. The student decides to ask their parents about their views and ideas and it just so happens that they are both professors with a PhD in history.

Me, being a black girl and all,my parents always reminded me that my assessors fought for us to go to school: ""And you have no right not to go"". Up until 2017 all we ever knew was that public school is the only way you can get your education.

4790D181C8D5,"Conclusion.School is about educating yourself, so you can take on the great big world. When students decide to do distance learning, they take on the decision to learn everything themselves. Yes there are plenty of online videos and teachers you can watch in order to learn the information needed for testing, but who's to say that they're giving one-hundred percent correct information. There are literally whole human beings that will willingly teach over seventy-five students each day just for you're convenience. When I was younger my teachers used to score my writings with a three out of five or either a two out of five. That may not seem that bad, but from a girl who gets four out of five or five out of five on essays now, that's such an accomplishment. Of course I can't give myself all the credit because I know that it was my former teachers who built me to become the writer that I am now. Teachers literally made a writer out of a girl who couldn't even spell ""great"" correctly ",3,2,178
4790D181C8D5,Conclusion.Having children to complete all assignments at home is very dangerous. Especially when they're left to test on their own. When left to test during distance learning there's nobody around to check whether you're actually learning the information or not. You could easily cheat on an at home test and not even know what you're being tested on. ,3,2,59

School taught me social skills at a very young age which allowed me to be comfortable around others, and it opened me up to be inviting to people I don't even know. See, children benefit off of public schools, but at home distance learning can't really benefit children in this area. Distance learning allows you to be by yourself, which isn't very good all the time. Too much time spent alone learning information by yourself can cause you to become a hermit, or even worse, it can cause you depression.

4A292725EE82,"Conclusion.Sometimes, you need to have multiple people to help solve the puzzle. ",5,2,13
4A292725EE82,"Conclusion.If someone were to ask one hundred different people what their favorite food is, they would probably get 100 different answers. This can be applied to advice because, if someone were to ask several different people for advice, they could get completely different advice from different people, and, chances are, some of the advice can really help instead of giving the person that needs advice useless information floating around. For a moment, imagine that it's time to vote for the President, and person 1 has no idea of who to vote for.

So person one goes back to his/her good friend person 2, then asks, ""Person two, who are you voting for?"" Person two replies with his/her chosen candidate, and person one asks several other people, and finally, person four tells person one about the candidate that he/she has chosen, and person one also votes for that person, because from what person four said, that person will do great things as President. If person one had just asked person two who to vote for, he/she never would've known that person four had chosen the candidate that was right for person one's beliefs. Another benefit to getting multiple people's solutions is that the different advice can be applied to the same problem until something works. For example, person one is trying to fix that pesky flat tire on his/her car, and then the advice that person two and person three gave. Because person one can't get person four to help, because person four is on vacation in Norway, person one decides to apply the advice of person two and person three to see if something works, and it turns out that person two had good advice once person one figured out what person two was trying to say. Basically, multiple answers can lead to the best answer and many solutions can be applied to the same problem until something works. ",3,2,321
4A292725EE82,"Conclusion.This is beneficial because, of course, past experience with the problem can lead to better advice than advice from someone that has never faced the problem. For example, person one, once again, is having trouble with the cursed car, so person one goes to person two, person three, person four, person five, person six, and person seven. Person two, person three, and person five all give some advice that they found on the internet, person four offers to help but really doesn't know what he/she is doing. Person six just shrugs and says, ""I don't know what to do."" But person seven was a car mechanic for a few years, and person one didn't know that. So person seven not only gives advice that helps fix the car's current problem, he/she also fixes it to the point where it doesn't break down twice every week. The point is, if you go to multiple people for advice, chances are, you'll find someone with hands-on experience that can help you with the problem. ",3,2,173
4B201D2C2152,Conclusion.Talking to three people will help anybody with something they cant decide on. If somebody says one thing and then you say another. The only solution is to only get help from one other person. So that you could have three including yourself. ,4,0,44

But if George Mason is not in fact the best college for me, even though the person I asked was trying to help, that one opinion could sway me to go there anyway and not have the best experience. But yet if I go to ten people to advice, including the person who suggested George Mason, they might be the only one who would say that and maybe five of the other people I asked might say Virginia Tech, and I would decide to go to Virginia Tech instead of to George Mason, and I would overall be happier and maybe even get better grades. Then I would be more successful because I went to multiple people before I made a decision that could affect my entire life. So therefore even though one person still has a chance to give valid advice, it is safer to talk to multiple people because it increases the chances of making a bad decision.

The things I believe, such as that multiple opinions provide open-mindedness, multiple similar reccomendations can be reliable, and that listening to suggestions does not mean one needs to follow them, have made me believe that it is always practical to take other ideas into consideration and decide which option works best in whatever situation one is in.  ",1,2,74

4E7557A13281,"Conclusion.If it seems like there is repeats or everyone is saying the same thing, then go with that thing that is repeated. When the majority think that it is the best possible solution there's a good chance it actually is the best possible solution. Another thing that may happen is the advice may go back and forth and you are getting a lot of both sides or both opinions. Then in this case you can see which side has more experienced people giving you that opinion. For example lets say I am doing a school project and want to figure out how to organize it. Would I use my two younger siblings advice even though they have never done this type of school work, or would I take advice from my parents and older sibling who have experience. The answer is obvious, even though there are almost an even amount of people on both sides, you stick with who has experience. Finally my favorite way of using comparing and contrasting the advice. If you have a bunch of different opinions and none of them really match up or there are no patterns and repeats, you get to make it. In this case you can pick and pull parts from all the advice and build your own advice for yourself based off of other people's ideas. Being able to compare and contrast the advice you receive gives you a big advantage on how you want to deal with your issue. ",3,2,250

Some important choices cannot be made with any bias, for example if you owned a company and needed to pick employees to hire picking your niece who as no experience in the field, nor any desire to work at your company is not a good choice. However using advice from other workers who help run the company you could find someone to pick with more experience and with desire to work there.

523EBD9ECA47,"Conclusion.People can listen to others' point of view, which may make it easier for them to decide what decision they're going to make. For example, a month ago, I was in the process of selecting my courses for freshman year, but I was unsure if I should take regular Geometry or Geometry Honors. So, I found a time to meet with my guidance counselor and asked her for her personal opinion. She believed that it would be a mistake if I took the honor class because she was afraid that I would be overwhelmed with the workload. After some thinking, I decided to ask for advice from my math teacher, who encouraged me to enroll in Geometry Honors because she'd noticed that I've consistently maintained outstanding grades since the beginning of the school year. Finally, after listening to both sides, I decided to take Geometry Honors. ",3,2,147
523EBD9ECA47,"Conclusion.Receiving help from professionals doesn't necessarily mean that they know what's best for someone, but they can certainly serve as assistance if someone is facing a problem. For instance, a couple of months ago, my friend Generic_Name was struggling with drafting her college resume. She was at a disadvantage because she didn't know what steps to follow to write her resume, and the worst part of it all was that her school guidance counselor was unwilling to take the time to help her. At first, she attempted to write it herself without any guidance, but then her old friend, Generic_Name, who already graduated from college and is now an English professor at Generic_School, was visiting during that week. He noticed how frustrated she was with her essay, and decided to sit down with her and give her some pointers. After finalizing her resume to the best of her ability, Generic_Name decided to make a copy of it to give to her English teacher, Ms. Generic_Name, who is a notable alum from Harvard University. Ms. Generic_Name gave her some feedback, but overall, her paper was ready to submit. Generic_Name sent it out to Santa Monica University, and received her acceptance letter a few months later.

534835158D10,"Conclusion.Each person comes from a different background, they all have their own knowledge and ideas. Consulting different people will lead to tons of information on whether you are making the best choice. One example is that publishers make authors send their books to professional editors, editors advise the authors to add some of their ideas and fix any mistakes that are shown. This goes to show that having another person that will give helpful bits of information will help make a much better decision. 
",3,2,85
534835158D10,"Concluding Statement.It is crucial to consult more than one person for their opinion or advice about something when you are looking for the best choice you could possibly make. By asking them for their advice or opinion you will get a different perspective on your choice, you will also receive tons of ideas and information to help make a good decision. Having more people consult on a decision helps the person making the final decision narrow down and decide what choice they should make. Like people say ""Two minds are better than one!"". ",1,2,95
53F1450AF8DF,"Conclusion.I often have trouble making decisions about anything, I could be asked what I want for lunch and an hour later I still wouldn't have decided what I want for lunch. For example, I didn't used to eat breakfast at McDonalds, but one day I was hungry and I couldn't decide on what I wanted for breakfast, so I called a few people and asked for a few opinions about Sausage Mcgriddles. Some people said they were terrible, so terrible in fact they would be comparable to eating dirt; however, many more people said that Sausage Mcgriddles were delicious, they said that biting into a Sausage Mcgriddle was like biting into a world of pancake, syrup, and sausage heaven; they said it was a whole breakfast in one sandwich. So, now that I had seen from both viewpoints of the situation I made the choice of eating a Sausage Mcgriddle; and in my opinion it was the best choice I could've made. ",3,2,163
53F1450AF8DF,"Conclusion.When people face difficult decisions and they a few choices they often try to come up with their own reasons as to why they should choose any one choice. Unfortunately, people, like myself, aren't the greatest at coming up with their own reasons. So, when you ask multiple people their opinions, you can base your choice on more than just your own, most likely self-centered, reasons. But, if you only ask one person then you're only going to get a few reasons that are based on one opinion and when you can't come up with reasons yourself a few reasons and one opinion isn't helpful.

59CD6F1E3E98,"Conclusion.A shy person may have a different view than a super chatty person. For example, my friend skipped four questions in an english assignment; she hit submit on her computer and got four questions wrong because she did not see them. She could not talk to the teacher because she had a substitute that day. She asked two friends, one was a little shy and the other one was super chatty. The shy friend said to email her teacher telling her what my friend accidently did, the other friend said that she should wait until the teacher was back and talk to her in person. She did not think of emailing her teacher and explaining what happened. It is more likely she would have waited until her teacher was back and then not gotten full credit on her assignment. Talking to multiple people gave her a solution that she would not have thought to use and worked better better than her original idea.

5B222B47AA21,"Conclusion.The other day I was watching a movie. The movie was about a court case in which jurors had to decide if a man was innocent or guilty. The trial gave a lot of useful information that was used in the decision making but, as they went deeper into the mystery, more information was brought to the table. At first twelve out of the thirteen men thought that the man was guilty but as more and more information was discovered by the man one man who though he was innocent, slowly the other jurors who once thought the man was guilty thought he was innocent. At the end of the movie the man was in fact innocent. If that one juror hadn't brought new information that was relevant to the case, they probably would've given the man a improper accusation. This is a great example of how having many opinions can bring relevant information to a decision. ",3,2,158

5C3B7683D560,"Conclusion. Because classes will take place on digital devices, it is possible for students to text or even call their teachers and classmates. If people have an issue with the fact that you cannot see the other person's face, there is always the possibility of video calling him or her. Communicating online is arguably just as good if not better than communicating face to face. Students who have difficulty interacting with other people have the option to simply text or email them, while students who have no problem socializing can call them. Letting students choose a communication method will allow them to be comfortable in their working environment and motivate them to try their best to learn.

5C5EB17E8684,"Conclusion.The choice you make can effect anyone in a negative way, although you may not be aware of it. That is why you should ask for an opinion(s) for it. You don't know what will happen when you make that choice and who it's going to effect. ",0,2,48
5C5EB17E8684,"Conclusion.Depending on what choice it is, it may effect people's daily lives. What most people don't like is change (especially if it doesn't benefit them). The choice you made could change the routine of the person's daily life, they may have more to do or his or her schedule could be way different than before. When you change something about a person, there could other people who depend on them to do something but they can't because of the choice you made. It could be a policeman or a firefighter that has his or her schedule changed, then somebody needs help but the policmen or firefighters aren't doing his or her job right now. Lastly, all of this makes you look like a careless human being. All humans judge based on a person's first impression, it wouldn't help if you ruined everyone's lives. It's like the butterfly effect, or like dominos. If you didn't care less about just asking one more person for his or her opinion, maybe this wouldn't have happened. ",3,2,173

Some people also might have already experienced the situation that you are dealing with, this will give you input from someone who has already been through the same situation, you can compare this with what you are dealing with.

5D48FA3291DE,"Conclusion.When there is a situation that needs a solution, the best way to find a solution is through discussion. When only one person is asked for advice, there will only be one discussion, and there will be only one point of view. When multiple people are asked, the person asking for advice will have a lot more discussion about the problem they're facing. When asking multiple people for advice, the person asking could also bring up previously heard points of view and see what everyone else thinks of that opinion. Once the person asking hears many opinions, and opinions on others' opinions, the discussion created will help them think more about the problem, and ultimately find the right decision. ",3,2,120

5F1ED0796466,Conclusion.this form of education is restrictive in the sense that it has the potential to be diminishing towards the necessary social development needed for students to succeed in society. ,5,2,30
5F1ED0796466,"Conclusion.Hands-on learning has been notably successful across the K-12 community in ensuring that students are not only consuming the information they are receiving, but also applying them in practical situations. This is especially common in CTE courses, where students have the opportunity to operate machinery and complete manual work to prepare them for the demands of that corresponding career pathway. Online schooling, in contrast to a standard public education, fails to fulfill the psychological and tangible necessity for students to fully engage with their learning. Learning through a screen only addresses the consumption of material, while in-school education promotes the routine of a workplace, where employees are not only technologically skilled, but are required to perform manual work as well. ",3,2,121
5F1ED0796466,"Concluding Statement.In-school education is necessary for all students in order to provide an effective education system that encourages the fair success of our future in a competitive capitalist society.

62FC97D29846,"Conclusion.Taking online courses is different from physically going into school buildings because in the buildings, students sit at a desk and are instructed by a teacher, versus, online classes require communication via email or conference call. As a result of this, online students must develop initiative and independence. They cannot rely on constant reminders from teaches and classmates about when assignments are due, additionally, because they have the freedom to complete assignments at any time prior to the due date, they must have time management skills so not all tasks are left undone until the last minute. The students must also acquire mental and emotional strength, as they will always be studying alone in their homes without the comfort of their peers. When the students learn to acquire these traits, success in their online courses and beyond would be inevitable. ",3,2,141
6348F3FAB2F4,"Conclusion.This is because when you receive biased opinions and advice, the information you are receiving is often not as factual and more from the heart of what the person you are asking believes. This is why when asking only one person, you are more likely to find someone who is very biased. On the other hand, when you ask more than one person for the same advice, the odds are higher that you come across someone who is unbiased, and has probably done some research on the topic. An example that would show this is voting for an elected official using one persons advice verses voting an elected official using multiple peoples advice. On one side, using one persons advice can result in a much more simpler reason to vote for a official. This also allows for a lot less stressful voting process as you do not have to compare different candidates. However, using multiple people means it is more likely that you will get more unbiased results. This also means that you can kind of figure out what the general ""popular vote"" is, or in other words, what the general majority of people are voting. This example shows that asking one person for a solution does not always allow for the best solution because most of the time, you are not receiving unbiased opinions unless you ask multiple people. ",3,2,231
6348F3FAB2F4,"Concluding Statement.
Asking multiple people for advice allows for better made choices because they will have most of the information needed to make a decision, and asking multiple people will result in a higher probability to find someone that is unbiased. When trying to get the best choice for a solution asking multiple people can allow for your decision to be unbiased, informed, and the overall most common choice. Remember, the best choice can always be backed up by others.

63AFEF7824B1,"Conclusion.For example, when you need that push to do something you're scared of they can help you with that. When they tell you it went well for them, it helps you to follow in their footsteps. If there was a problem in their past experience they can warn you not to do that. One example might be that a girl dated this horrible guy who cheated on her, and she sees him with another girl so she talks to the the girl and warns the girl about what happened to her. Asking a person about their past experiences is one of the best ways to figure out what is right for you to decide.

You can even get advice on which classes to take next year or what sports you want to do or how you can convince your parents to let you do the sport that you want to do.

The best way to get better at sports is to seek advice from people who have played it for a long time.

Most sports like basketball or wrestling are just experience dominates.

In basketball if you are guarding someone with a lot of experience then it is going to be a lot harder because they already know the sport like the back of their hand.

It is always the best to seek advice from older players.

Being this early they would have to be ready by about 7 AM or maybe even earlier. He or she would then have to wake up at a comfortable time maybe 6 AM or earlier. The day before they had homework which they didnt finish until about 5 PM. To get more than 8 hours of sleep at that point you would need to sleep before 10 PM. This leaves the student with not even 5 hours of the day for himself. More time could be allocated to extracurricular activities if the student did not have to worry about getting up in time for the bus. ",3,2,190
6F271187D67D,"Conclusion.People who are critical to this topic could say that bad weather could take out energy thus making it useless, ",2,0,21
6F271187D67D,"Conclusion.Student's without power would have more issues to deal with that would also disrupt their learning, so it would only be logical that learning for that day should be halted. There are more scenarios where distance learning would help in these conditions rather than have no impact. For example, on a snowy day, roads are too dangerous for buses and drivers to come to school. With distance learning, students would have the ability to still experience a full school day without their learning be crippled by transportation. ",3,2,88
6F271187D67D,"Conclusion.Finally, less money would be spent on transportation and less stops would have to be made. ",0,2,17
6F271187D67D,"Conclusion.This could save student's more time in the mornings, and save the school money to enhance their learning experience. Buses would have less mileage and more gas. Student's who drive wouldn't have to worry about expenses towards their transportation. Also larger amounts of people can be accommodated by the school due to less people being physically in the classroom. More money could also mean raises to teachers which would satisfy the ongoing issue of teachers feeling like they aren't paid enough. Students will also be more enticed in a school career due to a larger salary. Schools will run a lot more smoothly and the field would be infinitely more respected by the new generation. ",3,2,116
712C7781C2D9,Conclusion.Doing school work at home could give an individual with ADHD an outlet to let out energy by giving them breaks inbetween classes. A student could use the break to run outside or do a physical activity. Once they get back from taking a break they will be calmer and more focused. ,0,2,53
712C7781C2D9,Conclusion.One thing that effects teenagers today the most is depression. Depression effects an abundance of students on a day to day basis. For some individuals it can come and go but for some it can last longer. Some students have it for weeks and some for even longer. The people who suffer from it the longest are chronically depressed. Depression can make someone unable to get out of bed in the morning. It can make an individual see trying to get an education as pointless and make them stop caring about their future. ,3,2,94

73CDE1582FCB,Concluding Statement.I believe home schooling and or home bound is a wonderful thing to have for kids. I feel that we learn better when were alone and get to study a subject or unit as long as we need so we know it. In school units get taught so fast that students that learn slower than others dont really have a chance to get to know it. In conclusion i love the fact that we have al these different opertunitys for everyone.                  ,1,1,83

73F69FA2E0E3,Conclusion.I argue that need to be aware of that their options are in order to branch out to do those things and schools give children that push to try out these new things and change them to their own liking. ,6,0,41
73F69FA2E0E3,"Conclusion.Children wont simply do things because they exist, they need a push to try new things, and schools offer that by having individuals that share a passion for something show it off in amazing ways. Ways such as concerts, recitals, or showcases for the arts. ",3,0,46
73F69FA2E0E3,Conclusion.Being exposed to things allow students to grow a fondness for them and venture out of their comfort zone; something that distance learning is not able to do. ,0,2,29

7443D525E32D,"Conclusion.Some parents do not get a full scope of what is going on in a students school day, and it can sometimes be hard for kids to communicate this to their parents. Some parents tend to job the gun when they take a look at their grades and are seeing their kid isn't doing too well, but what they aren't always considering is the other factors that go into it. A students grade could be reflective of not only their work ethic and focus, but how well a teacher is teaching them, and the sort relationships between other kids in the class. If a parent is able to be present when a student is working on their courses, they would be able to get a full scope of how their student learns. Not only that, but the student would have less distractions from other kids, and hopefully be able to avoid some of the flaws of an individual teachers style of teaching. ",3,2,163
7443D525E32D,"Conclusion.But to that I would say; there have also been many successful people in history such as scientist, Albert Einstein and entrepreneur, Gary Vee, who either dropped out of high school or didn't find themselves doing so great until university. ",6,2,41

7450531F9573,"Conclusion.Each person interprets everything you say differently and think about things differently. for example I was wondering if I should start writing an essay now or wait a little bit and brain storm. I asked my mom and dad what I should do and my mom said that I should think and do a little bit of it now, then later go back check it and do a little bit more. I didn't even think of doing that and it goes to show that asking multiple people can provide new ideas and ways of thinking. According to a philosopher if man gets caught up with work and close his mind to other ways of going about it, he will need someone else to open it for him. this explains that different opinions can help one open their mind to different things and make better decisions ",3,2,146

""Well I'm still going to ask Generic_Name what he thinks because you might have a biased opinion and you don't know it!"" Generic_Name answered. Biased opinions can seriously affect a companies sales, or a consumers choice, or even what materials are used to make the product in the first place! When using something that is biased, you get something that could be a much worse choice. Using non-biased opinions from friends and family is much more reliable than using a biased opinion since you are more likely to get a better product or service if you go based on facts, and not opinions.

764CF7C9DF70,"Conclusion.For example, college applications now require a multitude of skills and are looking for variety within the application pool which results in students scrambling to participate in a lot of extracurricular activities and taking a heavier course load to stand out. With these new additions come with a much more time consuming schedule and title to no time for the student to recuperate and recover from the day's events. If the student could take online classes and be permitted to arrive late or leave early to/from school, this would open a large time frame in which the student can do whatever they want. This extra time could be used to relax, be dedicated to homework, or even sleep for longer, really whatever the student wants to do with it. No matter what they do though, it is obvious that the opportunity to have a reduced schedule inside the school building would greatly benefit the student since it allows he/she to just feel like they have a choice in life, rather than dedicate very waking hour of his/her life to school. Speaking from personal experience, spending too much time dedicated to school can lead to a very quick burnout and feelings of exhaustion, both mentally and physically, which in turn causes my grades to suffer from school, ironically.

7B751C9BE162,"Conclusion.When someone knows less about a situation it is sometimes better because they see everything from an outside perspective creating a less bias opinion or neutral opinion. When you ask multiple different people for advice on one topic, you are searching for a general opinion/ idea or a pattern in what people have to say to then influence your decision. If you chose not hear from a few people one persons opinion may be bias and can heavily influence your decision in a good or bad way ",3,2,88
7B751C9BE162,Concluding Statement.Not only will you be building your knowledge on how to deal with those kind of situations but you are also learning how to put together ideas to form your own. Asking multiple people will push you to think more and create a well thought out plan. You also learn not rely on one specific person just in case their opinion is bias when it comes to a certain topic.

Distance learning, if implemented, will allow for students to remain at home and hopefully away from the virus while still being able to complete their lessons. Not only will this allow for the students to not fall behind on their school work during this period of time, but it will also allow for the school district to not need to add in extra days to the school year. Other cases in which distance learning can and has been implemented is in cases of students contracting mono, having severe eating disorders, or having some form of anxiety.

907B493FEF99,"Conclusion.It is alarming to think that less than twenty years ago virtual technology was just being invented, and ever since the turn of the 21st century the world has started to use technology and virtual data more and more. The world has started to trend in a direction in which humans rely on technology. For example, tools like phones and cars are used everyday. Virtual technology can be helpful however, and it is currently expanding to provide humans with new ways to make life easier. One way technology is being introduced to benefit humans is through distance learning or online classes. This new form of learning allows students to attend school from the comfort of their own homes. ",4,2,119
907B493FEF99,Conclusion.Distance learning gives students a more customized and adaptive learning experience while giving students more time to engage in the extracurriculars they love. ,5,2,24
907B493FEF99,"Conclusion.For example, Students in the public education system can only enroll in courses that are offered at their school. This may restrict students from taking classes that they are interested in or limit students from branching out and potentially finding a new passion. However, students taking online classes can choose from a wide variety of classes, that most likely incorporate their interests. The lack of restraint in regards to the courses offered in distance learning is beneficial for students. Not only do student have the freedom to choose what to learn, they also have the freedom to choose when to learn. Having the freedom of choosing when to learn is vital for students with specific needs or disabilities. When students are unable to go to school, learning can continue. This eliminates sick days, weather delays or cancellations, and school holidays. Furthermore, students are able to take courses at their own speed. Rather than the typical every other day school schedule, students can master a course in less than a month. The lack of restraint in regards to the courses offered in distance learning and when a student can learn is beneficial for all students. ",3,2,195
907B493FEF99,Conclusion.Another benefit to learning from home is that it gives students more time to focus on their needs and wants rather than the schools. ,0,2,25
907B493FEF99,"Conclusion.In certain cases when student prodigies are more focused on a sport, a musical instrument or a job, learning from home can grant students more time to perfect their craft. Online learning allows them to have their primary focus being on what they love rather than on a rigorous and time wasting traditional school day. Another example is in the case of a student that does not thrive in a the social aspect of school. Sometimes kids feel overwhelmed and threatened by the large amount of students in one school. In order to feel comfortable, kids could video conference into school and learn from the comfort of their own home. School can be long and sometimes overwhelming so in certain cases distance learning can be beneficial. ",3,2,127
907B493FEF99,"Concluding Statement.Learning is essential to grow as an individual but also as a population and with new technology, accomadating for certain needs is easy and beneficial.

It has been proven that stress only causes harmful and emotional side effects to individuals. So, why not remove it? That is exactly why simple checks on your work, or something you may be unsure about can make a real impact. As stressful as everyday human lives can be, there's no harm done in taking a little out of your time to ask others about your situation and how to deal with it. Being more sure on something can cause an individual to worry less and end up making better decisions. Maybe you have a huge decision coming up like a proposal.

It doesn't matter, even if they've never had to make a decision like this before, they can still have good input and information about the topic. Learning from others mistakes and gaining knowledge and information increases your chances of making a good decision because you learn what will happen if you make a decision. Some might argue that only you know what is best for yourself and you should make your own decisions. I agree with them, but you have to keep in mind that I'm not suggesting that other people make the decision for you, only that you you get multiple views and hear what others have to say.

They might not be able to help you find all the pros and cons, but bringing together multiple people ensures that you get the facts you want. I wouldn't want to make a choice without knowing the cons of it. I want to know all the bad things that might happen even if it's for the best so that I can prepare for it.

A2A749DEC4BE,"Conclusion.Wednesdays, after school, I work as a consultant to the writing center. In the club, younger students, usually from seventh grade, come to get help with their writing from older, more experienced students. Many times, seventh graders come in with half finished essays that could barely be considered rough drafts, but as it turns out they've already turned them in and need to re-write them for a higher grade. The process can be difficult, and sometimes grueling if the seventh grader doesn't want to and cooperate, but I still love consulting. Working there is a joy, but one of the things that really makes us able to go above and beyond to help other students is the ability to cross check with other consultants and work together. Often, seventh graders are assigned only one consultant to help them with their work. However, like I've said above, one persons opinion can definitely be flawed ",3,2,154

Always make the right decision and the good choice not the bad choice. ",3,0,166
AD53B357BD0D,"Conclusion.One way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is that by asking more than one person, they can get more input. ",0,2,26
AD53B357BD0D,"Conclusion.By asking more than one person for advise on a subject, they can get more than one new idea that isn't one of their own. This way, they can get more than one person's thoughts on the decision, and have different ideas on it. For example, if someone were trying to make a decision on what sport they may want to tryout for at school, they could possibly ask their friends and family about which they should choose. However, they should also ask people like classmates and teachers, as they may have their own ideas, and won't give the person any biased ideas or information. Friends and family can have a great deal of influence on people, so it's important to always get people's thoughts that are on the outside. This will make it to where there's a greater chance of the decision maker not being biased, as they've heard numerous people's thoughts, and can make their own decision off of that. 
",3,2,163
AD53B357BD0D,"Conclusion.The decision maker can use all the advise they've gotten from different people to make their own choice, and feel better prepared. They will be more focused as they know what they want to do, and will feel more confident and less overwhelmed. Feeling less overwhelmed can be a big help as the person doesn't have to be so worried, so they won't have any distractions from making the best possible decision. For example, if someone is trying to decide what kind of car they want to get, and they've gotten advise from numerous people, they can make a better choice when picking. They'll know exactly what they want, as they've heard many thoughts from the people around them, and so they can make their final decision.

AE6BE874B204,Conclusion.One way that distance learning would not be beneficial for students is because it will not prepare them for the set up of college ,0,2,25
AE6BE874B204,"Conclusion.In almost all colleges, the classes offered are in large lecture halls where you are face to face with the teacher and other students, and not separated by a screen. By participating in distance learning students may not be prepared for face to face interaction with their teacher and the other students. For example, my brother, who is now a senior in college, participated in a system similar to distance learning while he was in school. After having participated in online and video conferencing classes for almost all of his school career, he had a much harder time adjusting to the college style of teaching than the other students, from his same high school, that did not participate in distance learning. Another way that distance learning would not help students prepare for the set up of college is that the students that participate in distance learning will have trouble adjusting to having to leave their house to attend class. In college classes are not offered inside of dorms and students will have to travel outside of their living area. If students do not practice taking classes outside of their home in high school they may feel uncomfortable learning in an unfamiliar environment and that could affect their learning abilities when they get to college. ",3,2,215
AE6BE874B204,Conclusion.The final reason that distance learning is not beneficial to students is because it allows students to become more easily distracted ,0,2,22
AE6BE874B204,"Conclusion.In a student's home they have access to toys and electronics such as phones, televisions, and computers that can take their attention away from learning. However if students took classes in a school building they would not have access to as many of these distracting things, and they would also have a teacher that would be able to take any distractions they find away from them. Another way that distance learning would allow students to become easily distracted is because their is no other students around to keep them on task. By taking their classes inside of a school building students would be surrounded by other students who are also doing work. Being surrounded by other students who are also doing their work will help motivate students to continue to focus on their own assignments. Personally, I prefer to do my homework at school, in my study hall period, as opposed to completing it at home. I would rather do my work at school because I am surrounded by other students that motivate me to finish my work, and also their is less distractions around me. One specific example of how doing my work in school benefits me is when I had to complete my history project on Andrew Jackson. Instead of working on my project during my study hall period, I decided to take a nap and told myself that I would be able to finish the project at home. However, when I got home, instead of working on my project, I was immediately distracted by the television and ended up watching a six episodes of one television show instead of finishing my project. When I received my grade back on the project I saw that I had received a C+ instead of my usual A. If I would have completed my project in study hall I would have been more focused on doing the project, due to the other students also working on assignments around me, and I would have received a better grade.

AF9AAA672210,Conclusion.The last opinion my sister got and the most important one was Beyonce. She has been a family friend for a while and my sister has always really loved her fashion sense. So when Beyonce heard that my sister needed to go dress shopping she was more then happy to come along. Her job was to help my sister pick out the dresses to try on and then give her opinion. Her way of giving her opinion was just to first point out all the things she liked about the dress and then something that my sister maybe want to consider. I think Beyonce was the best at giving her advice because she has to do it all the time with her music and what she wears for all of her performances. ,3,2,133

A great example of this is when she couldn't take a important test, but didn't know when she should make it up. She asked me what she should do, and I told her that when I missed a big test, I tried to find a solution with our teacher beforehand, like taking the test early, or a few days after the actual test date. Generic_Name knew she couldn't take the test early, as she had another activity taking up her time, but she went to our teacher and asked if she could take it later. Generic_Name figured out a solution by asking others for advice, and found the best choice for her using my experience. Now, she can also use both mine and her experience to make decisions later on inn life. Using my experience to find a solution is not the only way for Generic_Name to solve her problem though.

It's one of the best ways you can get help anyways. There are over 1,000 different information data bases that can help you find information on anything.

They looked interesting and beautiful, but to see what the artist wanted you to see you had to stand on footprints that had been painted on the asphalt and look to see what the mural was of. When you have a second person to give you their opinion it is similar to looking at a mural from a different perspective. The first way that you look at the mural is interesting, but it is even better when you change to where the footprints are: the best choice to stand. Having a second opinion can help you choose the right perspective and right choice. ",3,2,125

Getting a second opinion helps you make the best choice because you have another person's opinion based off of their experiences.

Listening to the opinion of someone else is useful because they will know different information and facts than you. Perspectives that people have are developed from what they know and have experienced, so getting multiple opinions helps you learn another perspective that could be more helpful towards making the correct choice.

BF619ADE9BF4,"Conclusion.The more trials you have in an experiment, the more accurate your results will be. Let's use Generic_Name for an example. If Generic_Name had only listened to Generic_Name, then he would be up to his ankles in empty potato chip bags and energy drinks. It was because he asked multiple pterodactyls, that he was able to get the right advice. This doesn't mean that Generic_Name was planning on being messy or that Generic_Name was trying to scam Generic_Name. They were just trying to be good friends. From a scientific perspective, when planning a science experiment, you would want to have at least three trials. This is because something out of the ordinary could happen in your first trial and that it usually takes at least three trials to recognize a pattern in the experiment.

If you are asking for advice - don't pick your favorite person. When I say this I mean people like your parents, your boss, etc. Although they could have good opinions, you might listen to them more than the other people who are trying to give you real feedback. Not only that but you don't want to have a person to lie to you and say that there was nothing wrong with your outfit or that your story didn't have confusing plot lines, when they both do. But on the other side of the feedback spectrum, don't pick someone who is going to crush your spirits. I once had a teacher in 6th grade that inspired me to learn more about the world's history and pushed me to learn. I even considered being a historian when I was older. Then, in 7th grade, I got a 72 year-old teacher who instead of having us learn about the Spanish-American War - stopped the whole class to look at pictures of his grandson. Don't get me wrong, I love looking at adorable picture of babies. But during the year, I lost my love for history and never thought about being a historian since. So what I'm trying to say is that you should pick someone you trust and that you respect and know that they will do the same for you. ",3,2,364

This means a lot because the first opinion might not always be the best one for you. So go and get that second,third or maybe fourth opinion it won't hurt it will only help and you have many different people with different experiences in there life to help you. For example you could ask someone who dose not have much experience in what your asking but then if you get a second opinion they could help you because maybe they have had experience with it sometime in there life. So if you would have just got the one opinion it might not have turned out good as it would if you got that second opinion. So just getting one opinion may not be the best choice. ",3,2,162

Many time studying at home give students many issues; there can be many people at home and too much noise that the student would not be able to concentrated and will get distracted. It can also happen that watching a video and that there's no one there to explain it; can make the students tire and he/she can fall sleep. Also, students will not take it seriously because there's not a teacher telling them and explaining them what to do. They would not receive as much education, information, and attention as they need. My position on this issue is to maintain the students attending to school. The students will learn more if they receive classes in school. Attend classes in a classroom with a teacher will provide students more support and it would help them in many ways to be successful in the future.       ",1,0,203

D7B12358DBA3,"Conclusion.As with many students, receiving an education and taking classes is associated with a physical school building. Students are often aware of the two main options for school: attending public/private institutions or home school. Each option offers different advantages and disadvantages but seem to be on opposite sides of a continuum. The option of taking online classes provide the benefits of both attending an in person school and home school. It can be seen as a middle ground on the continuum as taking online classes in addition to regular classes at school may increase learning ",4,2,96

D8C3DD3A74F1,"Conclusion.Some of these reasons are, transportation but that's not really common though, it can be an issue. Some students also find online classes easier because, it is basic steps and, instead of waking up every morning going to class you can just simply stay home and get the work done. Another reason why other's find real classes helpful or beneficial than, online classes might be based on their learning strategies for intents, learning better when taught to in person even though, online classes do the same with videos taught step by step. Another reason might be notes taking because, some students learn better when taking notes in class and,later on doing an assignment by looking at these notes but then, online classes is kind of similar to real classes, it is just the fact that there is no teacher teaching it in a classroom but doing it online.

DBC53691CD0A,"Conclusion.With the flexibility of online classes, students can start getting the idea of pushing school work aside to focus on other things. Unfortunately this mentality can get extremely out of hand, for their grades can start to suffer and their work load can pile up. Many students experience this chain reaction, therefore causing a lot of stress that can lead them to giving up. Having the access to attending a school decreases the ability to start this chain reaction because facing a teacher due to you not completing your work can be intimidating. Furthermore, going to your classes in person also gives you more work motivation because most of time you don't have the option to sit around and do nothing. Your teachers encourage you to ""use your time wisely"" when you are given the opportunity to complete your assignments during class, therefore giving students the extra push to actually do their work. When students are able to work on their own schedule due to taking online classes, it opens the opportunity to be lazy and not complete school work. This leads to students drowning in work because of their lack of work motivation.

DBCC1F8F92B5,"Conclusion.In sixth grade, I was student council president of my school, and one of the topics many students wanted me to address was on bullying. I didn't know how exactly I could help students going through this horrible ordeal, because many victims of bullying don't like to stand up for fear of more shame. When I consulted with teachers, students, and my parents, they all had an overarching idea of focusing on kindness and the prevention of bullying, instead of bullying itself. This was something I never thought of before and never would have been able to think of, but with the aid of many others, I was able to form a new idea for approaching bullying in my school. I established a wristband kindness program, where wristbands were given out to students who were seen doing kind acts, such as helping another student without being asked or holding the door open at recess. When those students saw another student doing a thoughtful deed, they would pass on the bracelet and continue the spread of kindness. This motivated many young children to become more generous and understanding, a trait that will take them far in life. This idea wouldn't have even have been possible if it weren't for all the kids and teachers that helped me decide what I should focus on as student council president, as well as giving me the ideas for the project. I was able to develop a more inclusive program from multiple opinions, which also helps provide different viewpoints in conflicts. ",3,2,257

DE2A70D1284E,"Conclusion.Specifically, it is more beneficial when you ask others who have dealt with similar experiences for help. When we do this, we find ourselves relating to others and taking their advice into greater consideration. Through this method, we gain knowledge on possible outcomes for our conflict and how it can be resolved. While filtering our own bias with this new information, we can formulate possible solutions for ourselves. This is an intriguing way that we can all solve our problems because we can use the experiences of others to better our own. Using the lessons learned by others to prevent yourself from carrying the same misfortunes is a key way to avoid conflict. This strategy allows yourself to feel more comfortable about handling the problem because you know someone who has dealt with the same thing. No matter how complex a problem can be, empathy from another who can relate will make the situation better. ",3,2,156

When I was in fifth grade, I was in my last year of Cub Scouts and I was getting ready to cross over into Boy Scouts. I had to choose what Boy Scout troop I wanted to cross over to. I couldn't decide on which one I wanted to go to, so I asked my great uncle, who was a very successful scout, how he decided which troop he wanted to join. He told me to ""find a group of scouts that I would enjoy sharing a meal or a tent with, because if you have that, your time in scouting will be much more enjoyable."" That advice led me to Generic_Name, they were all really nice people, so I ended up joining their troop. Four years later I'm still enjoying Boy Scouts, I've gone on dozens of camping trips, and made some of my best friends. Asking my great uncle for advice was really helpful in that situation.

E459422C794C,Conclusion.Perhaps you want to apply to a school and are having a hard time deciding whether to apply or not. Asking someone who may have gone to that school or had experience with something like that would be helpful because they know what its like. Then for another opinion talk to someone close to you like a friend or a family member to see if they think it would be a good fit for you specifically. These people also may see things that you dont in a situation. Seeing multiple sides of the decision in question really helps to make a clear decision. ,3,2,104
E459422C794C,"Conclusion.Since you've asked all of these people you should be able to confidently make a good choice that will benefit you. Going into something like a job or a try out is optimal for success. All in all more opinions makes a stronger and more sound conclusion to the problem at hand.

An example of this from my past experience would be when I tried out for junior varsity softball at Generic_School. I wasnt sure if trying out was gonna benefit me at all considering i'm in 8th grade and many of the girls out there have many more years of experience. I went to my dad for advice since he played junior varsity and has also seen me play. In his opinion he didnt think I should try out because its a lot to take on during 8th grade. Then I went to some of my friends for their opinion on it and they gave me the confidence to go and try out. Right now Im on the softball team and very happy with the choice I made to try out. ",3,2,183
E459422C794C,Concluding Statement.asking more than one person for their opinion on a problem is very beneficial. By asking more people you can see all different sides of the question. These people have different experiences which could cause them to see things that you cant. Having all of these different sides should make it so your final decision is something you can be happy and confident with. ,1,0,66

E53B5654C0E2,"Conclusion.For example when i needed help with a deciding if i should still be friends with some people. I asked my dad and my siblings for advice, my dad told me that if they dont make me feel good then I should not be friends with them. On the other hand my siblings told me that I should be friends with them because they said that I had so much fun with them and good times. Then I had to make a decision, and it was a tough decision but I ended up still being friends with them, the reason i stayed friends with them was because we had very good times and I did not want that to end. So me and my friends apologized to each other and we became friends again. ",3,2,135
E53B5654C0E2,"Conclusion.For example I saw this TV show named beyond scared straight, and it was about kids who have done bad things that go to jail for a day, and they talk to inmates and see how making bad decision can lead you into jail. Then on one of the episodes there was a kid named Generic_Name, and he was on beyond scared straight, and after seeing the jail and getting advice from the inmates, officers and other people he still ended up in jail. So then more kids came into the jail and saw Generic_Name, and Generic_Name gave them advice and all the kids were scared because one small mistake could lead you in to jail. and after that none of the other kids there got into jail, because they made the right decision from Generic_Name's and other people's advice.

Making the best decisions are very important, but know lets take a review. ",3,2,154
E64E850E6E71,"Conclusion.When you are given multiple opinions on the choice you are trying to make, like which university you should go to, you gain more information on both of the schools your trying to decide between. All of that information helps you to find what you want out of a school. When given multiple opinions, you can decide if your willing to live with all that freedom and responsibility in somewhere like New York City, and if your ready for it. Or you can confirm to yourself that your not ready to leave to somewhere completely different and far away, and you can't afford an out of state university. Those opinions can help you eliminate a variable, by thinking, ""Am I ready for what that person is advising?"" ",3,0,129
E7E7F9BA0F30,"Conclusion.They might have a different perspective on what you think you should do, or what someone else thinks you should do, because we all think differently. Understanding where people are coming from, even if you disagree can also help you come up with one executive decision. For example, there could be an occasion where you want these nice shoes , but you don't have enough money so you go and ask for people's advice on what you should do. One person says, ask a family member for the money. You ask another person, they say steal the shoes from the store. In this scenario it allows you to think and understand what both people are trying to say and the benefits of each and then you can come down to which is a better choice. Stealing shoes from the store could get you in a lot of trouble, So the clear choice is to ask a family member. ",3,2,158
E7E7F9BA0F30,"Conclusion.Like if you were to need opinions on what color to paint your room, people would most likely give you different colors. Sometimes multiple people give you the same opinion when that occurs in a case like this, you'd usually go with whatever people think the most. For example, if six people said you should paint your room blue, and everybody else said different colors, you'd most likely paint it blue based of what peoples opinions were. Receiving opinions in this case is very beneficial to see what people think, and gather ideas ",3,0,94

E8CA56DE95A2,"Conclusion.Learning about people's past experiences can really change your perspective. If you're talking to multiple people about wether to do something or not, and those people say not to because it didn't go well for them in the past, then the choice to not do that certain something becomes much more clear. For example, if you're not sure if you want to go cliff-diving, and the people you talk to are all saying you shouldn't because they got hurt while doing it, then the choice becomes pretty clear to not go cliff-diving.

Our generation has been revolved around technology, and has set the stage for the future. It is no doubt that one day their will come a time when students no longer come to school to talk to their peers and learn from their teachers, but instead learn from robots, in their dark rooms, only lightened by their computer screens and cell phones. Coming to school and sitting in a classroom, where are phones zipped in our backpacks and our laptops shut, is refreshing and healthy for teenagers. With online classroom, students would not be able to take physical education and run in the fresh air, and have a break from the technology they stare at throughout the day.
