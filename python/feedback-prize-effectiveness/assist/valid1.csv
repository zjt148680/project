Statistical proof show where it may help and real life examples of some of the effects of reducing, or getting rid of altogether, cars in one's daily life. While ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"" (Source 4), is that really enough or for the right reason?

0158970BC5D2,"Conclusion.When i was in the 6th grade, for fun, our teacher assigned the class to design a volcano that had to shoot up as far as possible into the air, made with paper mache, glue, and other accessible materials. There wasn't much instruction on how to do the volcano, as long as we were the ones building it, and the idea/design was original. Most kids' volcanoes looked pretty amateur, with varying degrees of success. However, the kid whose volcano shot up the highest, was disqualified for copying his design and materials exactly from a project someone had shared on the internet.

If a student can plagiarize someone's work from a project loosely designed by a teacher, then even more students can plagiarize a project that ""they themselves"" designed. ",3,2,129

For an example students are given a lot of homework and have chores to do at home like cleaning clothes, taking care of their pets, cleaning the house or taking care of their siblings. Some students are already tired from school and might not want to participate in any other activity because they have to wake up early for school and have to do school work really early even though science say that the human brain starts working correctly when it's ten in the morning so that means the human brain of a middle school might not work so well at six or seven in the gosh darn morning.

Say you thought that the dress code needed to be adjusted, you could join a club and talk about it. These clubs can be used to spread awareness for bullying. Someone could of been bullied and they want to feel part of something so they join a club for bullying awareness. Students should encourage others to be part of something at their school.

072BF1F05F66,"Conclusion.In the classroom, it is common for students to tend to get confused while being taught a lesson. It is also common for students to get bored and become uninterested in the lesson at hand. With the Facial Action Coding System, teachers can make sure that their students are acquiring the best education possible and absorbing all of the material. ",0,2,61
072BF1F05F66,"Conclusion.Teachers can adapt their teaching style according to how students respond to the lesson being taught. This way, both the students and teachers can be on the same page, making education easier for students and teachers. The article states,""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,'"" (D'Alto). In this quote, Dr. Huang is telling the reader how this new technology could possibly develop into something much bigger where it can modify the lesson for students who become bored or confused, making it an easier and better experience for the student. ",3,2,113
077A62D46D30,"Conclusion.They also tend to have a clear understanding of what they expect from students for the projects they assign. By assigning teacher-designed summer projects, the teacher can guide the students to learn what the teachers want them to discover. They also provide a more specific rubric so the students know exactly what is expected of them. For example, AP Biology has a lot of material that needs to be covered in just one year. To solve this issue, they assign a teacher-designed summer assignment that consists of an introduction to each unit learned throughout the year. This way, students are prepared when going in depth with all of the concepts in class because they already have a grasp of the topic learned during break. By assigning teacher designed projects, teachers can guide the students to ensure that what they are learning and exploring can help them perform better in class. ",3,2,151
077A62D46D30,Conclusion.Some teachers may argue that student-designed summer projects are an outlet for students to show their creativity. They believe that students can showcase their intellectual level by completing student-designed projects and the teachers can get a better understanding of their students' beliefs and preferences through student-designed projects ,2,2,48

07D3CBDEFCEF,"Conclusion.Emplimenting a computer system in schools that is capable of reading a students emotions is inappropriate, lazy, and dangerous. ",5,2,20
07D3CBDEFCEF,Conclusion.Sometimes not every one wants to be figured out and displayed to their peers. ,0,0,15
07D3CBDEFCEF,"Conclusion.Giving power to technology is complacent, instead of working with people to improve learning habits or teaching methods, adults would be taking the easy way out. ",0,2,27
07D3CBDEFCEF,"Conclusion.Their job is to connect and work with students. When introducing a computer system, students may realize they are just another task to be completed in the work place. Every year, students are analyzed to see where they place on the national benchmark for their education, they take standardized tests to see how much they know, they do hearing tests and eye tests, but a computer has yet to analyze them to see how happy they might be. If computers are introduced to read emotions, students may feel like they are just a number or rank of emotions. If students go to their counselors, they want to be talked to and connected with. Bringing in a computer can divide the connection from child to adult. The child may feel alienated and refuse to converse with the adult. This computer may seem like a helpful tool, but it destroys the importance of human connection. ",3,2,154
07D3CBDEFCEF,"Concluding Statement.The age of computers is inescapable, but it doesn't have to be. Instead of computer analyzed emotional connection, people should put their phones down and ask each other how they are. Not every person wants their emotions analyzed, especially in schools. Students bonds with teachers are simply student to teacher; a child must trust an adult before they talk about their feelings. Computer facial technology might be helpful, but not in schools. This technology falls flat in the category of connection. Don't take the easy way out, instead of analyzing emotions with a computer, ask someone how they are. If a student looks upset, sit down and talk with them. Show someone they are valuable and deserve one on one human interaction ",1,2,124
07ECEB4E4BE1,Conclusion.Though Venus is concidered the twin to earth it has many diffrent features making it dangerous for scientist to explore the planet. One of these extreme dangers is the diffrence in climate as said in the article Venus reaches upwards of 800 degrees Fahrenheit easily melting most metals making it hard to recieve samples from the planet. ,3,0,58

0821EB1AEDED,"Conclusion.they can continue learning in a more ideal way. 
",0,0,10
0821EB1AEDED,"Conclusion.Teachers often put a strict instructional guide or manual on what to do and what not to do, during the assignment and limits what students can do and blocks any originality. However, having a student-designed project will unleash a wave of ideas and flow of creativity between each student that would not normally be received from a common project. The whole outcome of the entire project will be changed drastically because of the freedom students will have on their own projects and in which, in the end, will satisfy them. During research projects, teachers also frequently limit the student on what they can look up and use. If the project was student-designed, students can freely look up and use what interest them and learn about something that will make them more engaged into the project. They can not be held by idea blocking rules that will make the project disengaging, they can have creativity run free throughout the entire assignment and it will show. Overall, a student-designed project will make a more standout project due to the original ideas students will leave throughout the project. ",3,2,186
0821EB1AEDED,"Conclusion.The thought of a project is always a dreadful one that all, will have a hard time to get them self to do it but a student-designed project will make it at least, a more enjoyable experience. Students can utilize their brain and knowledge to make it a project to remember and have fun while thinking of an idea to blow teachers and fellow classmates away once they return from break. For example, a science fair allows students to show a unique idea with experiments, this causes fun competition and a enjoyable process on how the project is going to ""wow' the judges. Speaking of competition, if the project would also have an incentive to try to achieve the best project, students would even be more thrilled. The student-designed project will show a big amount of their own ability to the assignment and make them strive for the number one spot. This would heighten the accomplishment of the project and give them a sense of excitement for their own unique project to compete with classmates. In the end, rather than having a normal boring project, students who have a chance to design their own project, will have a lot more fun and excitement in the process of doing the project, in which, will still allow them to learn and not interrupt with their fun and relaxing summer break. ",3,2,229
0821EB1AEDED,"Conclusion.When teachers assign projects that are related to the class, it is reasonable because it help us understand the subject more, but when they assign a regular project, especially one over summer break, it is often a misguided project on what they think students want to learn but does not really aid them. Giving the chance for a student to do something they want to learn about, will get them more engaged and give them their ideal way of learning. They would not have to worry about what teachers think they should learn but rather what they want to learn and will aid them in the future. Students who do a project about what they want to learn will make doing a project like that more enjoyable over a summer break rather than a set learning experience. They will gather more information to aid them in what they want to do, instead of being given something they think they should do, this will make the learning experience way beneficial for them and not waste their time in the long run. They can continue to learn educational information for them and gain more knowledge that matches their learning style and will satisfy what they have learned. Therefore, students would have a better learning experience if they could do projects their own way and had design freedom and not be held down by a set learning path. 
",3,2,236
082E19093947,Concluding Statement.Student based projects would be more likely done then teacher based projects. Students would do them off of things they are interested in and subjects that catch their attention. They will do it around there time frame and in any style they want. doing it student based will have students educate them selves about things they enjoy and love to do on daily bases and teachers will have something turned in to them by the end of summer. ,1,0,80

0BB223A348F6,"Conclusion.One of the many needed traits in life is leadership and is gained from setting a goal and reaching it. Leadership is an important trait because it shows your character and is necessary in a workplace. An example of a student-designed project is the Science Fair. The Science Fair allows students to choose a project of their own and complete it for a grade. The Science Fair is a perfect example of successful student led projects which also help gain leadership. Another example of a student-designed project is the MYP assignment. The MYP assignment is assigned to 10th graders, in Virginia, and are supposed to make a project from scratch. Their project is allowed to be anything they want and in any format which helps the students gain leadership skills when they finish. Important traits like leadership are gained from student-designed projects ",3,2,143

0BDD43321AFD,"Conclusion.Summer is the only substantially long break that students receive off of homework, assignments and tests. Through the months of August until June, school does not cease. Almost every week, robotic-like students must wake up early Monday morning, suffer through eight hours of sitting and listen to a teacher go on about something like, why did the War of 1812 happen, how to dissect a frog, or solve for x. Five days are filled with this repeating schedule with two days to spare, and in my experience one of those days is set aside for weekend homework. No matter how much someone loves school and learning, eventually they need a break. Summer is the time to cut loose, hang out with friends, travel somewhere you've never been before and relax. Almost everyone has seen in a movie how students throw their books and papers up in the air as soon as that last day bell rings. Imagine receiving a final project the last day of school, requiring students to turn in on the first day of their next year of school. Now if that project was teacher-designed it might require a student to: 'write an eight page essay on the effects of propaganda use in your society' or 'create a tri-fold and 3-D display of a past, indigenous, tribe's village'. Just picturing these assignments make some people cringe. However, if summer projects were student-designed, people could create a piece of work that interests them and hopefully enables them to put in more effort on the assignment because it wouldn't feel as much like a school task ",3,2,267
0BDD43321AFD,"Conclusion.Student-designed projects could focus on what students question or wonder about in their day to day lives, peaking their interests and making the task feel more fun and creative. Students could receive a broad outline like 'write an essay' or 'create a display', and turn it into a unique piece that expresses themselves; something like a paper on endangered animals. ",0,2,61
0BDD43321AFD,"Conclusion.During summer a lot of trips and vacations are taken whether with family or friends, near or far. Nevertheless, each one requires people to leave their homes and travel with the minimal amount necessary to save space. In my experience, I once was gone for almost the entire summer. One week I was in Pennsylvania with my relatives and the next I was swimming in the crystal clear waters of the Bahamas. Now imagine if these vacations, no matter how long the duration, were to be taken away from students because of a teacher-designed, summer project. If one was to receive a project of this type, there is no way of telling how much time or the location required to get it done. For example, if teachers were to design a summer research paper on the history of where you live, it might be necessary to go to the public library to view history records. No one can do that or go there if they're skiing all the way in Colorado. ",3,2,172
0BF9F64D6FD1,"Conclusion.Students across all age groups look forward to the last day of school, the day summer vacation begins. From the endless memories summer entails, to the exciting, fun experiences, summer vacation is one of the most beneficial times for students. For many high school students, teachers assign summer assignments or projects that relate to a class they may be taking in the upcoming school year. These assignments tend to require an expansive amount of time and also tend to be rather ineffective. In the summer students want to fill their time with exciting activities that they would enjoy. We live in the age of self exploration with some the most inquisitive students, but we still conform to the age old summer assignment system. ",4,2,124
0BF9F64D6FD1,"Conclusion.Some of the most successful people are regarded for their fame and success due to self exploration. In Benjamin Franklin's famous autobiography, he shares his experiences through self exploration. Growing up in a poor household, Franklin's father could not afford to send him to a traditional college education, but through Franklin's own personal endeavors and exploration, he became one of America's founding fathers, discovered lightning, and paved a legacy that is still remembered today. Simple self exploration can start with these summer projects. When a student is given their own freedom, remarkable results can follow. The purpose of a curriculum is to mend our future minds into strong, independent thinkers, so by implementing simple strides of self exploration, schools and teachers are able to mold the minds of successful students. In my own experiences, self exploration has made a remarkable impact. When I was 15 I started my first company, learning everything on my own with the help of a few mentors along the way. Not only did I grow as a person, but my knowledge for business also grew tremendously. Through the use of online resources, videos, and contacts, I was able to produce something I am truly proud of. The work I put in, was time I wanted to because I was truly passionate about what I was doing. That passion is what we need to strive for. From simple opportunities for self exploration during the summer to long term projects, as a society we need to move towards encouraging self education and self exploration. ",3,2,258

Someone could be the next Albert Einstein and focus on school so much that he didn't have time for extracurricular activities, but you decide to hold him back because of a silly little thing he didn't do. Whether students do extracurricular activities or not shouldn't determine if they proceed to learn new things. The administrators should look at their grades and their work habits. It does not make a valid reason for them to be robbed of their opportunity to be smarter, if they just didn't participate in an extracurricular activity. ",3,2,114
1006FE578078,"Conclusion.Some students have trouble socializing with others. So maybe they didn't apply for an activity because they just didn't want too. Some students also enjoy their free time, time where they can do homework, be on their electronic devices, or just take a nap. So they didn't want to do an extracurricular activity because they didn't want to give up their free time. Students shouldn't have to feel like they are forced to do something.

11950E4412E5,"Conclusion.Summer break is the most anticipated time of year for students and teachers because it is a grace period that allows for relaxation and refreshment,of one's soul. The summer sees,the mental maturation of many students without the hindrance of a classroom,holding them back. The learning experience offered in a classroom setting is limited only to what the teacher and state permits. Students are not fully able to express their learning passions because they are forced to learn what the teacher permits. Whereas, during the summer students are free to conduct their own personal investigations on topics that peak their interest, resulting in a much maturer student by the time fall rolls around.

During the summer, many students travel to new places or try new things. For example, last summer I was blessed with the opportunity to travel to Japan with my friends and family. While I was there I tried new cuisines,participated in festivities and I was able to learn about their history. My time in Japan, sparked an interest that I never knew I had in Japanese Geisha. I spent hours upon hours researching everything I could on them. But, my research was limited because I had to complete an AP Human Geography summer assignment administered by my future teacher. My assignment was to write a paper and create a brochure about a country. I thought it would be a perfect opportunity to write all about my trip to Japan. That is until I realized the teacher had already selected countries based on our last names. I was stuck with Great Britain, a country I already had a lot of knowledge of from history class and videos. I like many students completed the assignment without gaining any new information because doing the project felt as if it were a chore. Though,I do still remember the information I learned from conducting my own research into Geisha. ",3,2,231

Some teachers assume that all students are capable of doing only one thing, which is very untrue and unrealistic. Students should not be limited to doing one thing, in one way. It's unfair that some teachers grade based on how artistic the assignment is, or how technological it is. Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. Teachers should look towards all their students specific strengths, instead of aiming at their weaknesses.

200AA7A37060,"Conclusion.Over the years many schools have assigned summer projects as a way to help keep students minds active while on break. These projects can include reflection essays, construction, reading catalogs, and many other wonderful things. At the moment many of these projects are designed by the teachers, however many schools are considering switching to projects designed by the students. ",4,2,60
200AA7A37060,Conclusion.Students designed teacher approved projects would be better for the future of education ,5,2,14
200AA7A37060,"Conclusion.Often times struggling students or children who ""hate"" school may just feel bored and there are many students who don't try in school because they feel like the subjects they study have no purpose or that it will have no value for their future career. These students often do not participate in teacher designed summer projects as many see summer as their time off from the burden of school and teacher projects appear as boring and useless to them. If these students were allowed to design hear projects, however, so that they focused on topics important to them there could very well be an increase in their participation and desire to learn. When people study things they like and enjoy the often perform better this can be seen at schools like the Generic_School MATA programs where every student who attends wants to be there and as a result they are active and engaged each day. It can be inferred that if the logic applied to the MATA programs is applied to summer projects, students studying things they enjoy increases learning motivation, more students would participate and find value in summer projects.

Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit"". So apparently this process goes beyond just looking at the face,but actually looking for the movements in facial muscles. The author also talks about the muscles that present certain emotions such as the ; the muscles above your eyes (frontalis oars lateralis) raise when you're surprised,the muscles around your mouth (orbicularis oris) tightens your lips when you're angry, and more. This shows that the computer breaks facial expressions down to a science. ",3,0,139

20C01368FC3E,Conclusion.One key factor for students is a sense of independence. Students are growing older and majority of them want to do tasks on their own. Doing their own projects would give them that freedom. ,0,2,35

In Paragraph 3, the author does not give a higly convincing argument. Humans need oxygen to live, so how is it expected for them to survive on a planet that has little to no oxygen?

If studying a planet is as difficult as the author is saying here, then Venus should be abandoned because even if NASA was able to study it, there is obviously no way that the planet will ever be suitable to live on.

216A05AF987E,"Conclusion.Often, when teachers ask if everyone understands the material, students who do not understand, will be too emabrassed to ask for help, or the teachers, with such a large class, will not notice if one or only a few students are falling behind. Furthermore, in the article, Dr. Huang states that ""'most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" meaning that most communication is picked up in other ways, such as visually. Unfortunately, often in a classroom setting, teachers must face away from their students when writing on a white board at the front of the classroom, or in similar situations, which means that without the visual connection, much of the communication between students and teachers is lost. The new technolgoy could help with this problem, as it could identify students' emotions even when a teacher's back is turned, and thus could alert teachers and help them improve their lessons to fit their students' needs. It could also help evaluate emotions that teachers do not notice, such as if a student is confused, they may try to hide it. This new technology could identify these emotions and help the teacher make sure all of their students understand the material, which would lead to an improved quality of teaching and learning. ",3,2,211
216A05AF987E,"Concluding Statement.The quality of learning in a classroom setting could be improved by teachers knowing the emotions of their students, which would make new technology such as the Facial Action Coding System, valuable in a classroom setting.

22FD17FB1BEB,"Conclusion.Doing a project you're uninterested in can be very bland and boring. Teachers don't think about how uninteresting a topic or project can be to a student. Not having interest in a topic can be very detrimental to a students grade and the effort they put into the project. The same reaction can come from a boring class, students will start to loose focus, dread doing the work, or not put in any effort. I've personally experienced doing a project I had no interest in. I subconsciously procrastinated which lead to turning it in very late. I could not focus on the task and was drowning in work by the time it was due ",3,2,115
22FD17FB1BEB,"Conclusion.Summer break is commonly associated with spending time with family and going on vacations. This is the case for most students. Giving students a long, details, mandated project is time consuming and takes away from their vacation. As a child of a divorced couple, my summers are filling with traveling to see my dad and spending time with him. I've personally experience having a summer project that I had to take time out of seeing my Father to do, which was upsetting because I only see him once a year. It's students like me who would love the chance to design their summer projects. ",3,2,105
22FD17FB1BEB,"Concluding Statement.Some schools assign students summer projects to assure they continue to learn during their vacation. These projects should be designed by the students. The projects should be student-designed because teachers have high standards. Due to these high standards their projects require students to push themselves when all year that what they've been doing. Lack of interest plays a huge role in many teacher's projects. Teachers aren't doing their best to assure that their projects spark some aspect of interest in their students. Having no interest in a project can cause the student to procrastinate and not do their best. Lastly, students have complicated schedules in the summer, many go away on vacation or spend time with family. Having a teacher designed-project that's time consuming can take away from their valuable time. Letting students design the project can ensure they will have enough time to work on it and will encourage them to finish it earlier. Student-designed projects can benefit the student immensely in multiple ways, where as a teacher-designed project will let them down and cause unnecessary stress. ",1,2,180

2321FAC1E823,"Conclusion.To begin, the students have been completing teacher designed work all school year, so it is only fair to give the students a break and allow them to design their own projects. Additionally, the projects are assigned as work over the summer, so they should not feel like the same work that students are being assigned all year long. Because the students have been working very diligently over the year to complete many different types of assignments from teachers. It would not be fair to the students to essentially continue that trend of assignments into the vacation. Finally, a student designed projects allows for more flexibility. This flexibility allows the students the opportunity to create a project that will be conducive to a busy summer schedule. Many students have to travel or go to summer camps, so they mightn not be able to complete to work which a teacher who does not know the summer plans of a students designs. However, it the student designs their own project, they will be able to make it work with their summer schedule. ",3,2,181

23C653E16CC8,"Conclusion.In the early years of space industry, numerous spacecraft have embarked on missions to the planet, but they were not able to return home. Unlike Earth, Venus has an atmosphere that is ""almost 97percent carbon dioxide"" with a surface temperature averaging ""over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"" and an ""atmospheric pressure [that] is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet""(Paragraph 3). Due to these extreme differences in temperature, pressure, and air content, Venus would be fairly inhospitable for humans. Usually when NASA launches missions to other planets they are trying to find alternatives habitats for the human race in the event that they cannot survive on Earth. If humans will not be able to withstand the conditions of Venus it is no longer a good option; therefore, it is not worth looking into since the author provides evidence that Venus would not be a useful living environment in the future.

24C5ED476177,"Conclusion.Being constantly ailed with stress and work is definitely not beneficial for a persons' health. Teachers especially, who work in an environment surrounded by teen drama and the potential spread of sickness, need time off to recover. Forcing them to plan and grade massive projects during their supposed ""time off"" is unfair to them. During the school year, teachers often have no time to waste to spend with their own children, because they are so focused on having to grade those two-hundred papers for school. Giving teachers time away from the stress of other peoples' children gives them time to set aside for themselves and for their kids.

259C732E5942,Concluding Statement.They get to try something new. They could try something that they think the don't like but then actually do. They can make new friends. So I think it is a good choice for students to take extracurricular activities. ,1,0,41
25C32F08C197,"Conclusion.In almost all class rooms nation wide there is a similar routine. Learn something, practice it for homework and then see if a student is understanding it by taking a quiz over it. While this may be effective, it can be imporved ten fold with the Facial Action Coding System. The technology could understand emotion of students in present time. A teacher wouldn't have to wait to give out a quiz to see if students were having issues. They could teach the subject and then immediatly know if students are having difficulty unerstanding it. Dr. Huang, the creator of FACS, states that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". If teachers are able to recieve this information, their teaching would become more effective. Teachers could change lesson plans in order to fit the needs of the students, and give extra support and help to those children that are still struggling. FACS can also help excite studnets about learning. This is important because no matter how much a teacher trys to help a student, the studnet will not imporve in anything if thet do not want to learn. If computers are able to read if studnets are excited or bored by a lesson, teachers would add visuals and what not to make it more intersesting to a student. This would make them want to learn, not them being required to learn. totality, the ability to be able to percieve students emotions would help students academically by allowing teachers to change lesson plans that allow for more excitment and understand in classrooms. ",3,2,267
25C32F08C197,"Conclusion.Emotion is in the brain, not the heart. The way the FACS understands emoion is simple. It maps out a 3-D model of the face, looks at the shape and positoin of all the muscles, then it associates the different facial movements with differet emotion. For example, your orbicularis oris (muscles around your mouth) tighten your lips to show when you are angry. It even works when a person it trying to mask emotions. During a fake smile, the zygomatic major stretches the mouth sidways, while in a real smile the zygomatic major lifts the corners of the mouth. These examples can show how science IS able to understand emotoin, probaly better than most humans. Arguments that use that falshood, that science is unable to understand emotion, is completly false.

25C41D233D24,"Conclusion.First it can make them want to stop trying to get good grades, simply by giving the student a lot of work and barely any time to relax. Second it can stop the student focus dead in it's tracks, just because there is a little too much work for the student to keep going and work. Third

It will also slow down the student work rate and make them feel like they need to study more which then will put the student in a very bad mental place. Those were also some reasons why, you should not need to take a extracurricular activity to pass the school year. ",3,2,109

28314B1AC842,Conclusion.The process of coming up with rubrics and topics in which the assignment could be upon can be difficult. Team collaboration is vital for creating an assignment along side teachers and other students. Having the ability to voice an idea or criticism can be useful not only within school but also in an work environment. Not only having to create but also complete their assignment helps develop a sense of work ethic that is helpful in any situation. Students often rush to complete assignments very last minute and having formulated the assignment they would have a better understanding of how to space out their time to complete the summer project correctly. Along with school assignments this skill can be applied to any work place. ,3,2,125

28E2327785FC,"Conclusion.According to the National Safety Council they reported that ""cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year"". They also reported that ""nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. With those outrageously high statistics, I strongly agree with the idea of doing away with cellphones while driving. Also, 94 percent of drivers support a ban on texting while driving and 74 percent support a ban on hand held cell phone use. Having that high of a support percentage shows that are many other people who feel the same as I do. It is a very dangerous problem that is going on in todays day. With myself being a high school student and driver, I can first hand tell you this is a major proem with teens. I see many of my friends and also other students of my school using their cellphones while there driving and putting themselves in dangerous situations. ",3,2,163

They only way we get any idea of venus and its surface is from the human eye. We are never able to get close anough for samples because we would need to get extremely close and we cant because of its heat, gases. Venus could easily burn through most metals from earth, but astronomers think using old technology or a mechanical computer could help figure out more on venus.

2A665076893F,"Conclusion.The planet venus also known as the ""Evening star"" is one of the brightes in the night sky. Venus is also like a twin of earth the characteristics of this planet is alike except for the speed and the size.

A thick atmosphere of about 97% of carbon dioxide covers the planet venus. When you pass that the surface of the earth is 800 degrees fahrenheit and verry deadly to any creacher that lives on earth. the atmospheric pressure is 90% than what we experience here. So why do scientist still study and figure out how life can form on this planet? well...Scientist want to study this planet because they believe it was similar and an earth-like planet. When the planet was and Earth-like planet it could have supported the life that lives on the actual earth now. On venus there were oceans,rivers,valleys,and ect. could we return to this planet? Scientist say that returning to earth is indisputable. Scients also want to figure out how they can send people there and be successfull? NASA want to design a blimp like vhical that can hover over venus without touching the unbarable ground but would give little insight of the planet. Scientist could not take samples of rock or gas or anything eles. Many researchers are tryin to come up with an idea so that they can get all their information on venus. ",3,1,236

The system of recognizion is based to describe your emotions on certain things like as, if someone is not feeling well or if they need help with their work. We as humans, have a different variety of emotions that we can easily detect just by looking at their face. Most people will have the same face reaction all day meaning, if someone has a angry face and someone ask him if everything is ok, his respond is yes, is that his emotions and feelings do not interacts with his face reaction. In the Mona Lisa smile you can see like a pervert smile but at the same time, an inoccent. Determining different emotions associated with the facial muslces can truly help teachers to ditermine basic and normal emotions but also to see mixed emotions. As the Author says, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."", this means that not everyone will demonstraste how they feel in the inside, which not all students will have the same reaction during school and classes.

When she completed her task, she felt so confident in her work and even said, ""I'm going to do so good on this project. I know my teacher is going to love it."" Because of this, it was noticeable that she obviously felt confident in her outstanding drawings. She even became a better drawer from it. She turned in her project and got an astounding grade on it.

When we are looking in the mirror:

* raise your lips at the corner of your mouth,

* when you squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling at the corner of your eyes,

* when you hold it, rise the outer pars of your cheek up, toward your eyes,

In fact, these are instructionws for a face that looks happy.

In a real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at yourt cheek bones) lifts the corner of you mouth. (that's out instruction #1.)

Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sidways using the zygomstic major and a different muscle, the risorius. ",3,1,158

Teacher are not aware of the responsibilities or vacation plans of their students, so the expectations they would set might not be attainable for some students.

For example, a student would not be able to keep up with an at-home project if they were away for the majority of their summer.

Rather if they were to choose their own project, they could more easily manage how to carry out the project in consideration of their personal circumstance.

In general, students would be better at following their own judgment when creating and completing their own project.

Without any teachers to answer their questions over the summer, it is better for the students to be their own bosses.

31F4831C794D,Conclusion.When I first started playing Mortal Kombat 11. I was so excited to try out all the new and old characters and see what new things they can do. I told myself I want to try and use different characters than the ones I use constantly. So I do so and realize that I never really play with Generic_Name or Generic_Name for some reason but then when I tried using them in a real fight it never really worked out. So I had convinced myself that it was all because I never learned their moves but then something hit me it wasn't that i haven't mastered their moves in such a small amont of time it was because their moves were just the same as Mortal Kombat X and I am not really good at working with close ranged fighters. My specialty was at fighting with those who can attack at any distance. Zoners were my best bet at winning any match. Also like students allowing people to see their limits can help others know what they are good at and what they aren't and they won't feel troubled because of a few minor things that were out of their control stop them from doing their job. ,3,2,208
31F4831C794D,Conclusion.Truthfully it is just another way to tell someone no to doing this or that or it is a continuation of limiting people on their creativity. Back in 6th grade most people had a problem with the art tecaher because she had such strict rules in a way it was either her way or the highway. No one could really understand why she had us doing things this way or that way. With that being said everyone was hoping that one day she would actually miss a day and one day she called out but then I looked around me everyone was having a fun time because they could express themselves through their art. All students need to be able to express themselves without having someone telling them that they are doing things wrong. ,3,2,135
31F4831C794D,Conclusion.some people might say that is not true and if we allow students to do whatever they feel like doing then how are we suppose to make them do anything educational and how do you think it is going to help them in life. ,2,2,45

340734FCEDC4,"Conclusion.Not all students will feel the same, though, which is also where this technology could come in. At the beginning of a school year, perhaps, the teacher could use the technology on the class to see how they feel about the particular subject. Then, the students who are excited about the subject and show interest could be sorted into a class that can be run in a way that makes the class educationally suitable for students who actually want to learn that subject. The students that do not show as much interest, or none at all, could be sorted into a seperate class that makes the subject more fun, but still teaches the same points as the other class. ",3,2,120

""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. Two other Columbian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event. The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. In parks and sports centers their pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth, sidewalks. With all these changes, poeple who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. New York's new bike-sharing program and its skyricketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.

Paris bans driving due to smog

Many days of pollution caused Paris to form a partial driving ban to help maintain air pollution. Not only that Paris ordered many motorists to leave there cars or be forced to pay a large fine of 22- euros or $31. Many did what was said and many did not, if they werent cooperating they would pay the fine and have the vehicle impounded.

Most of frances pollution came from the favored diesel, they had a tax policy that supported diesel instead of gasoline. Due to the favoring of Diesel making up 67 percent of the vehicle gas consumption.

France earned many complaints from companies world wide, delivery companies especially. They complained over lost revenue. Thats not all, because of this complaint France had to make a couple exceptions like Electric, hybrid vehicles and a Fee as free as a bird for the transit (Friday through Monday).

Also, the art students create posters and fliers to advertise upcoming school events so that everyone can enjoy that event with their friends.

They are a very bright part of anyone's day, something that a kid could look forward to on a boring Monday. Also, they could find out new things they didn't have a clue about. A teen gets to talk to others near their age group who started out just being part of a crowd, but because they met them while playing the part of Juliet, they turned into a best friend. Additionally, we get to help the whole state while having a incredible time.

Not only is it the subject the teachers are teaching to them, but life skills and tools they can use in the future. If all the work that the students did was up to them, they would lack important skills like researching and communication that could help them in internships and the work world. ",3,2,157

3EEDE8AD3CB3,"Conclusion.This is because by allowing them to dictate what their project is about, it ensures that the student will select a topic that is interesting to them. This concept of self-selection is already applied to schooling today. For example, the ubiquitous science fair. Within a science fair project, students select a topic and create a science experiment surrounding that topic. By allowing students the freedom to select and design their own science experiment they are interested in, they learn and engage more than if they had, for example, participated in an in-class lab. This is especially important for a summer project due to the fact that, during summer break, students would rather relax than do school work. Especially so if the alternative was to work on a project that they had no say in creating. Essentially, ensuring students are assigned a project they are interested in ensures that they accomplish some learning over their break. ",3,2,156
3EEDE8AD3CB3,"Conclusion.laziness is not the sole reason a student may not complete a summer project. It is possible that they, or their family, have plans that conflict with the completion of an assigned project. For example, if a student were traveling to a location where they did not have access to resources or materials to complete a project. Or, if a student took on a summer job and the assigned task was too time-consuming to work on in conjunction with their job. There are a variety of reasons a student may not be able to complete a project. It is impossible for a teacher to take all possible factors into account for each of their students to design a project that is compatible with their summer plans ",3,2,127
3EEDE8AD3CB3,"Conclusion.some may argue that allowing students to design their own project encourages the design of lazy, easy, and uninspired projects. After all, why would a student intentionally design a complex project for a time span intended to be a break? ",2,0,41
3EEDE8AD3CB3,"Conclusion.However, both teacher-designed and student-designed projects open up the possibility of lazy work. Teacher-designed projects will inevitably suffer from lazy work while student-designed projects can suffer from lazy design. Either way, students will find ways to work less over their break ",6,2,42

Venus is the second planet from the sun and shares many geographical features with Earth. However, studying this planet is made difficult by the dense and toxic atmosphere, high temperatures, and violent weather. Despite this, some people think that Venus should still be explored, and the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is of this opinion. ",4,2,82
40BDB6D6B9A7,"Conclusion.First, the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is well supported by the author as seen through the many rewards of studying Venus ",0,2,29
40BDB6D6B9A7,"Conclusion.Although the author describes how Venus could be studied from the air, scientists still desire to learn about Venus from the planet's surface. One of their solutions to the problem of getting equipment to last on the surface of Venus is to expirement with new materials. ""Simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the choas of Venus's surface and have lasted of three weeks in such conditions"" (7). Research and experimentation taking place on Earth is giving scientists and astronauts more options for studying Venus. Although conditions on Venus are not hospitable to life, these new scientific advances are making it possible for data-gathering equipment to be sent to the surface of Venus and last long enough to gather data. Other scientists are moving away from traditional electronics and looking into purely mechanical systems. ""Systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces"" (7). The alternative that has presented itself to would-be explorers of Venus is older technology, like that found in the earliest computers. Scientists have realized that modern technology is too fragile and that more durable technologies are needed. By turning to other forms of technology, scientists are widening their options for ways to study Venus. The author mentions three different ways that scientists are making progress towards being able to study Venus - from the air, using new materials, and using old technologies. The author's postion that Venus should continue to be studied is supported by the scientific advancements that are serving to make studying Venus a reality. ",3,2,265

416154D38103,"Conclusion.By the way the article talks about how a ""home PC can't handle the complex algorithms"" and about how complex the system is, it makes people wonder just how much this system would cost and how complicated it would be to enstate said system into a classroom. Compared to a quick survey done by a teacher who asks their students how they feel about their methods of teaching, it is seen how the system would be a waste of recourses and money. ",3,2,83
416154D38103,"Conclusion.Therefore, although this system is useful in the fact that it can gauge the emotions of the students, it is not much more useful than a teacher who can do the same thing by questioning their students on their preferences and ideas. ",6,2,43
416154D38103,"Conclusion.Also, although technology is very much improved in these years, it is still not always accurate and infallible, and therefore may not be suitable for a classroom. ",0,2,28
416154D38103,"Conclusion.The article states that the technology associates each emotion with ""characteristic movements of the facial muscles"" and then uses those movements to calculate the spectrum of emotions based on their facial display. But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a ""false smile"", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile. Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education. ",3,2,237
416154D38103,"Conclusion.Lastly, if the physical problems of the technology have not already been offputting, then maybe the moral problem of this technology will sway opinions against using it in a classroom. If this technology really can ""indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one"", then this means it can invade people's privacy and indicate an emotion which a person is trying to hide.

Majority of students, nowadays especially with the amount of distractions they have, find themselves doing nothing all day and beginning their homework at 11:00 PM. When it comes to summer, the same applies; especially if given a topic they do not find interesting or relevant to them.

44E343ECD9B7,"Conclusion.In the sense that kids often time get bored in class, hence the reason they have a bad grade or get in trouble in that class, something has to change. Maybe it's the child's fault, but your traditional lesson isn't the most fun. If the instructor could find out what's boring the child and change the lesson to keep the child entertained then maybe the child wouldn't get into so much trouble with that teacher or maybe the child's grade in the class would take a huge leap. Who says learning can't be fun? With FACS learning could be something kids like to do. ",3,0,105

44E343ECD9B7,"Conclusion.When the teacher is teaching something that everyone but one student understands and the teacher stops for questions, that one student may feel too embarrassed to ask a question so the lesson would go on and only get more difficult as time goes by. Instead of that happening, FACS would let the teacher know what kid that is so that the teacher could reach out to the kid and give them extra practice or even a little tutoring if they need it, that could really be a huge help to children that don't learn as fast as others.

Whenever you have a project it's always more exhaustive to complete when you are not passionate about the subject.

But I believed there are not alien in the other planets or in earth because alien are not real but I have to makesure that I have to ask more question to the smartest scientist and ask about how did that face happen and how are we gonna prove about that. I have to ask more question about that too and they said that face look like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian style pyrmaids or even small shacks, you could see what they were. Some of them don't believe it because they don't see it and they just guess that answer. But when I looked at the picture I think I saw that crown and their face look shiney and in 2001 that face look destroy .

4E1A49DAA439,"Conclusion.Usually when assigned a project, there is a paper that has all of the requirements layed out in a convenient guidline for the students to follow.

Between the guidline and the teachers constant presence, the project loses a majority of its independance.

Having a project that is entirely up to the students will allow the students to learn to be more independant, which will come in handy later on in life.

4E1A49DAA439,"Conclusion.Student designed means every aspect.

They would be able to base their project on whatever they want. ",0,0,18
4E1A49DAA439,"Concluding Statement.Students should be able to design their own projects, rather than teachers.

Student designed projects will push them to put more effort into in, to achieve some independence, and to generally care more about what they are learning.

Especially now days, the curriculum in more so about teaching what will be on the standardized tests that we must pass in order to graduate, rather that the interests that the students actually have.

The mindset that we must prepare students by not allowing them to pursue their own interests needs to stop.

We should strive to make learning more fun and cater the the interests of the students.

When students know what they enjoy, they will be more prepared for the future in which they will not be stuck doing a job that they do not enjoy, to live a life that has little interest to them.

One of the biggest issues right now with highschoolers is that they have no idea what they want to do with their future. ",1,2,171

4EFC8F589A83,"Concluding Statement.students grow up with an endless imagination and one day eventually it dies when they grow up to become adults. That is why a student-design project can end up being more beneficial than supposed to having a teacher assign the students a project where they aren't going to have fun and in the end will probably forget what the project was about. Students learn better when they do something that interests them and benefit more from that then to do a project about the presidents.

Having a teacher-design project has minimal benefits, that is why having a student-design project, which opens up great minds and can help students comprehend better what they are learning when doing something they enjoy. ",1,2,121

4FAC3B29417F,"Conclusion.Teacher-designed projects are mostly straightforward, and have clear right and wrong answers. As a result, there is minimal room for creativity and originality. However, student-designed projects give students the ability to create an interesting and creative project, that captivates not only their attention, but the teachers that will evaluate it the next school year. For example, a student who is very creative may choose to design a project that showcases ways to use recycled materials in art. This project not only uses their artistic and creative abilities, but it also incorporates scientific and environmental strategies. ",3,2,96
4FAC3B29417F,"Conclusion.Some students who may dislike school, may discover a new found love of learning when they are given the opportunity to create the framework of their project. Students are more likely to enjoy a project on a topic that they have a passion for rather than a topic that is simply assigned to them by a teacher. Responsibility skills are also developed as a result of student-designed projects, since they not only are required to complete the project, but they also must develop the project. ",3,0,86

507CBD8E9670,"Conclusion.Venus is often reffered to as Earth's twin because it is the closest planet to be like Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Venus would be hard to expore becuase of the planet's suface reaching up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet of solar system and if we tried to land a rover there the metal would just liquify because of the extreme temperature's. NASA however, still wants to try to study the planet but they would have to hover over Venus because of the extreme conditions on the planet's surface. Even at 30 plus miles in the air in Venus the temperatures can reach up to 170 degrees Fahrenheit. However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere. Rendering standard of photography and videography ineffective. The solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth's level.

More importantly, reasearchers cannot take samples of rock, gas,or anything else, from a distance. Threfore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Many reasearchers are working on innovations that would allow the machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. ",3,1,255

5310CCBD5B81,"Conclusion.Venus is a planet in our Solar System, Venus gets often referred as the Earth's ""Twin"" due to the density, size and occasionally the closets in distance too ",3,1,29
5353165D1A68,"Conclusion.First off, Venus is one of the brightest points of light, making it simple for stargazers. Often called the Ëvening Star"" but the nickname can be misleadinng since the planet Venus is...well a planet. While also very simple to see from the distant safe advantage of Earth, it proves to be a very challenging place to examine more closer. It makes you wonder what´s even that planet to study about.

Next, Venus´ surface has their temperature average over 800 degrees and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than we experience on our planet. The planet´s conditions Venus has is way more extreme than we thought it would be that we wouldn´t be accustomed to the second we even try to get there. Beyond the high pressure and the heat, Venusian geology and weather present some impediments like volcanoes that can erupt, earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to seek land onto its surface. No wonder why Venus is fascinatiing in some people´s eyes.

Lastly, going over to Venus with a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can only have a limit insight on ground conditions since most of the forms can´t penetrate the dense atmosphere. It´s important to know that researchers cannot take samples of any rock, grass, or anything else in the distance. So if trying to seek to a conduct would have to resolve in getting close and personal despite any risks to do it. ",3,1,242

53E064890ABC,"Concluding Statement.
The problem we face with not having a policy of each student participating in at least one after-school activity, is that we have students who are immensely talented who are not motivated enough to be a part of a club. If the school was to have this policy every student would benefit from it as they are given a far greater reason to join a club. With the various advantages of creating this policy and minor drawbacks, each school should at least make an attempt to enact a policy that would not only help students but the school as a whole. With students having the added motivation to join the clubs offered at their schools, with the added diversity to the school, there is no reason a school should make an attempt to complete a policy like this. The principal at all schools should try to implement a policy that makes students participate in the after-school offerings that their school has.  ",1,2,163
5402D8B83297,Conclusion.Most students tend to actually do work when they are allowed to chose what it is. Students usually like making their own decisions. It helps them focus much more better and they will be having a great way to show the teacher they know how to do projects on their own. ,3,0,52

A lot of times teacher will get a lot of trashy work from students because they procrastinated the project all summer. The students will procrastinate the project till just a few days before school starts up because they do not enjoy the project topic. With the students given the ability to choose the topic there will be lowered procrastination in summer projects due to students enjoying the topic and wanting to do the work. ,3,2,91

5484CC372842,"Conclusion.Summer break is the time where most students proceed to pursue hobbies, enjoy lifes moments, spend time with people that are cared about, and make memorial memories. Over break, students tend to discover their true passions and focus on what drives their interest. With projects being assigned, that can be tough and build a wedge between the situation. If summer projects were to be student-designed however, students can make it more personalized and just have fun with it. I believe making the summer projects more personalized to students, can really ease the stress and make it more enjoyable. Overall, it is summer break. As a student myself, a time where this applied to me was in the summer of my freshman year. My teacher had assigned a summer project where we had to determine the area of different shapes in any form. Art is a huge passion of mine and I wanted to engage more of it into my summer. I decided to paint an abstract painting with a variety of shapes; circles, triangles, squares, you name it. It turned out beautiful, I really enjoyed spending my time on something that was educating and delightful. ",3,2,196
5484CC372842,"Conclusion.For most people, finding hobbies that are interesting can be challenging. Knowing myself, I need a sense of direction to know what my interests. It takes a bit of courage to try something new and actually enjoy it. ",3,2,39
5484CC372842,"Conclusion.Although students might think making school projects student-designed is a good idea, teachers might not agree. Some students could take this their advantage, by making the project as simple and pointless as they want. This could necessarily not reach the teachers standards and question if the student even learned anything at all. ",2,2,53
5484CC372842,"Conclusion.Although this could be case, summer projects are indeed just summer projects and should not be taken seriously. Summer should be the time where students can have the choice of doing what they want. If projects are mandatory for teachers, then it can be arranged, but it shouldn't put unnecessary stress on students. Especially during summer break. Teachers should observe how well the student comes up with ideas and how well they execute their projects, it's more exciting that way. ",6,2,81

561798F1DC3D,"Conclusion.Well it's getting close to that time of year again, summer time! Warm air, bright shinning sun, and many activities that are only available during the summer season. But if you are like some students who go to certain schools maybe not so much. Some schools across the country require students to preform school based learning projects during their summer break. There projects are said to continue in helping kids and teens learn about subjects outside of school. Most of the projects are given by the teacher for the student to complete but some think that this decision should change. ",4,2,101
561798F1DC3D,Conclusion.What many teachers don't realize is that teenagers are slowly being thrown into adulthood. Every year we have seen more and more teenagers be pushed into adult responsibility even when they are so young. Many students have to get jobs in the summer to support their families and help them. Some students work on farms which require all hands on deck. Some students even have wives and children to take care of. ,3,2,73

56193E77BB71,"Concluding Statement.With the constant evoultion of the way we learn, its not suprising that something like FACS was created. Emotions have been with everything living since the beginning of time. Before FACS, it was suprisingly difficult to read these emotions in people. Such a crucial part of our everyday lives could be easily hidden away by a fake smile or a theatre tear. But now that there is FACS helping out, looks are no longer decieving. ",1,2,77

57076BE40C47,"Concluding Statement.Having fellow citizens limiting car usage can have many advantages, but also a few disadvanteages. Cars can clean up the air but also make us gasp for it. Having a car should be a choice we get to make. Having events and days where ""no cars can be driven or you get a fine"" is not needed in anybodys lives. What decision would you decide, having a car, or joining in on being green?  ",1,0,76
5716C4DAFC9E,"Conclusion.Balance is one thing that is very important, especially when it comes to middle and high school; colleges look at whether a student can manage an activity with all of the school work as a big factor in the admissions process. For example, My older sister applied to UVA last year; She had straight A's, a great GPA and SAT score, but got denied because she wasn't a balanced student. She claims that if she would have had a required extracurricular activity, she would have had a better high school experience because it would force her to have a little more fun, which she needed at the time.

Another example of the lack of balance is that my older brother comes home stressed and angry everyday because he's so determined about keeping his grades up in high school. His favorite sport used to be football, until his classes started getting harder and he stopped playing. However, next year he is going to step down from one of his hard classes, so he can play football again and still keep his grades up; therefore, he will regain his much needed balance again. If our school continues to require these extracurricular activities, it will prepare students for high school by showing them that they need to have a balanced school-work life to both mentally and physically succeed. 
",3,2,226
5716C4DAFC9E,Conclusion.The final reason our school should continue to require extracurricular activities is because it gives students the opportunity to try new things. ,0,2,23

572236CAAFCE,"Conclusion.If students don't get the opportunity to work with a group, and to work as a team, then they wouldn't be prepared for life when they are older.

Learning to work with people is one of the most important things you need to know how to do.

So the sooner that you start, the better the future that you will have.

If you don't know how to work with people, then the path that is in front of you is rough because nobody will want to hire you, nobody will want to work with you, and nobody will have sympathy for you.

Nobody will hire you because they will look at your back round and see nothing in you that will help them in their work space.

Nobody will want to work with you because you will be mean and do little to no work.

Finally, nobody will have sympathy for you because they know that you had every chance to be successful, but you chose not to be.

The teachers' experience and expertise make the packets beneficial for students, as all of the information they have selected is considered to be vital. This allows students to be fully prepared for the course, because if they understand all of the background information in the packet, then they have all the tools they need to learn and understand new material later in the year. It also ensures that students do not forget any information they learned in the previous year, or, if they did forget it, that they relearn it.

5D934B4BED8F,"Conclusion.In Source One the story talks about the advanges of redusing car usage in the German areas. It states that cars produse about 12% of greenhouse gas in Europe and about 50% in major car usage areas in the United States. Also, street parking is generally forbidden on the outskirts of Freiburg. Even though Vauban's street are completly ""car-free"", except the main thoroughfare. Car ownership is allowed, but there is only two places to park, in a large garage outside their development where a space costs $40,000, or in their own homes. Because of this, about 70% of families in Vauban don't own car(s). Along with 57% of people that sold their car so they could move to Vauban.

In Source Two, in Paris, everyone who drove a car was fined, in two days about 4000 peopole were fined? That isnt actually a alot for a whole city, which is great news. Paris uses diesel fuel instead of gasoline, and now Paris is blaming that on their air pollution. Paris usually has more smog than any other European capital.

In Source Three, Bogota, Colombia has the Day Without Cars, where only public buses and taxis are allowed to drive in the city, anyone driving a car will be fined $25. the Day Qithout Cras started in the mid-1990s, and since then 118 miles of bicycle paths have been built. Parks and sport areas have also been built, along with more restaurants and shops near streets that used to be heavy with traffic, but now leave room for people to stop and visit.

In Source Four, it states that in the United States, young people driving decreased by 23% between 2001 and 2009. Recent studies show that Americans are buying fewer cars and getting fewer licenses each year.    ",3,1,299
5E3A5B645F49,"Conclusion.Most of the residents in Germany have given up their cars.

Vauban's streets are completely ''car-free'', this means that no one except for the main thoroughfare and a few streets on one edge of the community have cars. This movement is called ''smart planning.''

This movement helps the greenhouse gas emissions in Erope. Passenger cars are reponsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this evidence is given in paragraph 5.

David Goldberg states on paragraph 7 that all the development since the World War II has been centered on cars, he is promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars.

In source 2 the autor talks about one of the biggest advantages of limiting car usage, by cleaning the air from pollution. Cold nights ans warm days cased the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. In Bogota, Colombia they are doing a program that is called ''Car-free'' this is a program that allows people to have a day without using their cars, in souce 3 ",3,1,186

5E9118C7949A,"Conclusion.Students, or anyone, only grow and develop when they're exposed to challenges and obstacles it builds their mental capacity and their problem solving skills. If a teacher choices to do a particularly hard project or assignment this pushes the students out of their comfort zone allowing them to make these new connections in their brain and gain new knowledge and working skills. But if a kid is allowed to design their own project for the summer, most kids aren't going to do an extravagant or hard project, but instead take a more simplistic and easier way because the students want to enjoy their summer and not waste it on a school project. This would be a detriment to the students academics and the skills they could've acquired if they were to apply themselves. ",3,2,134

6198205BB70E,"Conclusion.Besides in the summer, students spend most of the year under the authority of their teachers. If the project they design is on their own terms, they would have more motivation to actually complete it. Since they are no longer under the school's rule during the summer, students may feel more motivated to do their project instead of being forced to do so during the school year. Students would also have more motivation if their summer projects were student-designed because they would not be expected to meet the expectations of their teacher. If the student designs their summer project to their specific skill set, the student may be more motivated to complete the project because he or she is capable of reaching their own goals. Students would most likely turn in better work because they are not under the stress of their teachers' expectations. Because of this, students would have more motivation if their summer projects were student-designed, ",3,2,159
6198205BB70E,Conclusion.Summer projects should be student-designed so that students may express their creativity ,0,2,13
6198205BB70E,"Conclusion.Productivity heightens when the task is something one actually wants to be doing. If the teacher is somewhat forcing the task, it will make students back away from what they need to complete. Since the student them self is coming up with the project, they must have more motivation to do so which makes the entire process much more productive. Especially during the summer, productivity may decrease because students are no longer in the correct head space that schoolwork requires. If the project is teacher- designed, then the productivity relating to the project will continue to dwindle as well. If the project is student-designed, the time and effort put into the project would heighten which would increase the productivity of the project as well. Hence my reasoning as to why summer projects should be student-designed rather than having them be teacher-designed. ",3,2,142
619D4176B04A,Conclusion.teacher-designed projects ensures that the project's purpose is fulfilled and that student can receive the help they need. ,5,0,19
619D4176B04A,"Conclusion.While it can be said that creating the project would allow the students to retain the information better, there is no guarantee that the information itself would be accurate. Any student can make a worksheet or an assignment based on what they have learned, but few can do it correctly. If student-designed projects are done incorrectly, then the purpose of the project is completely disregarded; the entire point of the summer projects is to make sure students do not forget valuable information. Having teacher-designed projects is a safer and more reliable option.

619D4176B04A,"Concluding Statement.The main goal of summer projects is to provide students with a way to retain everything they have learned and to be prepared for their next school year, regardless of who creates the projects. To best achieve this goal, teachers should be the ones who design the projects. Teacher-designed projects would provide everything that students will need, as well as allow them breathing room during their well deserved break from school. Overall, teachers designing the projects would be a win-win for everyone involved. The students would feel confident and prepared, while the teachers would not have to worry about going over concepts from the year prior. At the end of the day, as long as the students feel comfortable and prideful of their work that was created by a teacher, then that is all that matters. ",1,2,138

61A0FEA827E4,Concluding Statement.I believe student designed projects would be better for its simplicity and for all the groups involved to get a new experience weather its the manner of grading or designing it. Wouldnt you like to have more time to enjoy your summer break or would you honestly prefer a harder time doing whatever the teacher mightve brewed up while on their free time? ,1,0,65
61AD9851B39D,"Conclusion.Venus has been a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity. The thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide and highly corrosive sulfuric acid makes it difficult for spacecrafts to land on the planet. Scientist can't find out what they need to know about the planet. They want to know if there's a way to support life due to finding that Venus was probably covered with large oceans and could have supported life once. Today Venus still has some features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. ",3,0,90

In 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe,and manu countries were left ruins. To help these countries recover their food and supplies,animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to help the nation they are called the Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shiped overseas.

By the time he was discharged in 1947,Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acroplis in Greece was special,he says. So taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy,a city with streets of water. A cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.

It took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eatern coast of the United States and a month to get to china. Caring for animals during the crossings kept Luke busy. They fed the animals three times a day water,bales of hay,and bags of oats. Stalls had to be cleaned.

Summer Break one is thinking about all the things he's going to be doing, like:relax all day, go on vacation, hang out with friends or family, play video games, and do non-school related things.

How are people supposed to enjoy their summer break when a teacher gives them school-related stuff to do. Some teachers complain all the time about them having to grade all types of work when a student doesnt do his work.

6AE4BFE2E5CF,"Conclusion.Students learn in many different ways. Psychological studies have shown that there are different types of learning, from spacial to audio to visual, and students learn better in some ways than others. A rising awareness of mental health has also led to the understanding that brains process information in different ways, so students with autism or ADHD don't get the same results from the conventional classroom practices. Student-designed summer projects would be able to take all these different specifications into account when structuring the project, so visual learners could visit exhibitions while attention deficient kids could apply whatever technique they need to help them study (listening to music for some, a totally still room for others) ",3,2,117
6AE4BFE2E5CF,"Conclusion.As well, a student-designed project could angle more in the direction of what the student wants to learn about. Students are forced to spend hours of a day paying attention to subject matters that they don't care for in order to get a generalized education. However, the point of a summer project is education itself, not education towards the goal of a degree. Students would be able to design a project that deepens their interest in a topic, broadens their knowledge in a niche industry. Education would feel more like a hobby than a chore if a student could account for what they learn and how they want to learn it. ",3,2,112

Our emotions determine who we are and what we show from the expressions from our face. Its hard to determine what a person is thinking and what they are feeling at any moment of time.

People walked or used bycicles to get to where their were headed. ",3,0,75
6C3B801F92D2,"Conclusion.Ever since cars were invented, they have widely been used as the primary source of transportation. They became so commonplace that their widespread use started to introduce negative impacts . As a result, some countries, or cities, have recently put in place programs or events to limit, or decrease, the amount of car usage in that area. ",4,2,57
6C3B801F92D2,"Conclusion.In the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, the changes that the Columbian city of Bogota has gone through in response to less car use are discussed. The changes are a direct result of the city's Day Without Cars campaign, where car use is banned for the whole city for one day out of a year. It reads, ""It has seen the construction of 118 mile of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor. Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the city;uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"".  These additions are in response to the city's inhabitants using alternative transport. Since cars could not be used, the public had to get to where they were heading by other means. Bogota was able to use the situation to improve itself by either fixing things already in place or adding new ones competely. Another way that a city improved itself as a result of limited car use is shown by Elisabeth Rosenthal in her essay ""In German Suburn Life Goes On Without Cars"". She writes, ""While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs"". One of the results of applying this idea to suburbs is that stores are placed within walking distance of houses rather than in a mall next to a highway. Vauban, the city where the changes took place, is taking advantage of the opportunities to open new stores. This change would not only create more business for the strore itself but improve the economy of the city by increasing spending. The overall impact that limiting car use has had on citites is that it provides opportunity for the city to improve itself.

6DFB980B835D,"Conclusion.Having to do schoolwork over the summer is one thing, but making the work student-assigned is whole different ballgame. If the student chose what assignment's they would have to complete over the summer they most likely wouldn't finish it or not even look at it let alone take it out of their book bags. Teacher-assigned assignment's would make the student have to remember what to get done and when to have it done by or there will be consequence's. As a student they may not be fond of it but what it's doing is keeping them learning over the summer and starting them off nicely with solid grades in the upcoming school year. Think about this, during the school year if homework was optional who would do it? Now if a teacher assigned everyone homework and told them to have it done by a certain date for a grade, then see how many student's would complete their homework. It's night and day and the same thing applies in this case. ",3,2,171
6DFB980B835D,"Conclusion.Put yourself in a young students' shoes, you're in school for nine months and you finally can relax, go home, and just enjoy your time off because you did great during the school year and you deserve it. Then your teacher mentions summer assignment's that will be designed by him or her. The assignment's will likely be a load and it all has to be completed by a certain date. That's just completely unfair, because you work hard all year just to get time to relax and you can't. It's probably very overwhelming and young students need time to take a break and have fun especially after the long nine month slog they call school. ",6,2,116
6DFB980B835D,"Conclusion.The student would be working on their own time and not on any teachers'. During the summer when people are on vacation and need time off its a great idea to allow student's to get work done, but also have time to do what they desire over break. There's nothing better than working on your own time, having fun, and still getting things accomplished. ",3,0,65

This isn't saying to just stop using your car but just findfing a way to say that if you dont really need your car but just using it for fun then you could limit that use and instead of driving to places that are close to you just walk there.

The author of ""The End of Car Culture"" Ellisabeth Rosenthal even said that her own kids being 19 and 21 ""have not even bothered to get a driver's license...."" they find other ways to get around she said ""they organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends"" as i said before there are alternatives to limiting the usage of cars and this could be one of them if you are with friends and all are going to the same palce then you ca just share one car so that not all of the cars are ut it can avoid traffic and cost less money to you also.

709820813997,Conclusion.I agree with the principal that the students should participate in an after school activity. ,5,0,16
709820813997,"Conclusion.Usually when students get home from school, they use their time being on their phone or playing video games. When they go to an after school activity, they use some of their free time constructively. If the student went to the sports club, then they would get more physical exercise. If the student does yearbook, then they get to learn about different activities going on throughout the school. If the student participates in the student council, then that student gets to help the community through service projects. All of those clubs provide better use of the students time, rather than just sitting at home doing nothing. If the students actually enjoy cutting back on devices, then would try to manage their time so they are staying away from screens and doing something that is stimulative. ",3,2,136
70B291155F0E,"Conclusion.If students are being forced to add another thing to their plate are they really being set up for success? For example if a brand new high school student just moved to town and was already very stressed about catching up in classes, taking tests, and making new friends, being told they need to join an extracurricular would just make things harder. It would be better if they got time to do everything they needed and maybe choose to play a sport with some friends they made the next year or maybe sign up for yearbook, but by choice not because they had to. ",3,0,105
70B291155F0E,"Conclusion.Being with the people you love is so important so why wouldn't schools want to promote and value that rather than force their students to have schedules full of an unnecessary extra curricular that a student may not even want to do. What if you wanted to go to the mall with your cousin whos only in town for the weekend but you can't miss soccer so instead you spend 2 hours running laps and passing a ball, it would make anyone like that sport a little less.

70B291155F0E,"Conclusion.If a student is being taught you don't have to love the thing you're doing, what matters is you're doing it, are they really being taught the right thing? When they go to get a job that makes a lot of money but they don't really love the job they probably won't be as successful and happy but if students are taught early on that doing what you're passionate about is important, that's a whole lot more important than a random extra curricular activity that they only signed up for because they had to. ",3,0,95
70B291155F0E,"Concluding Statement.Students shouldn't be required to do an extra curricular activity, maybe because their busy, or maybe they would just rather spend time with friends and family. Either way the reasons shouldn't be questioned, but the choice should be given. So give them the choice, the choice to play football with you're closest friends, the choice to go to the mall with you're cousin, the choice matters more than the activity so why should it be taken away.  ",1,0,79

7277DA6BE697,"Conclusion.If a student is assigned something they find boring, they are less likely to try as hard as they would on a more creative assignment. Also, if the assignment is more open to interpretation, it helps students think more creatively. Students would be much more likely to complete, and better yet, enjoy assignments that they find creative and fun. Meanwhile, a student with a duller assingment would not put their entire effort into it, and would surely rather be enjoying their vacation. By making the assignment itself more enjoyable, students would be 10 times more interested and likely to enjoy it.

All teachers teach differently, just like all students learn differently, so having teacher-designed projects for over the summer can be a simpler task for the teacher.

Fun clubs like these are what will make the students enjoy the clubs. But having boring clubs at school like yearbook club can be boring.

7DF12B42AB72,"Conclusion.What's the problem with students designing their summer project? It's not hurting anybody, it's at their own type of pace, they are not being rushed into something they may not be ready for, and I could go on and on about it. In the students' mind, they probably think if they design their own time to do the summer projects, when they are done with the assignments, the work will more than likely be more proifficent and way more precise, rather than teachers trying to assign them the assginments at the wrong time for some students. I would that the teachers would take that to head and be more aware of what students have going on. ",6,2,117
7DF12B42AB72,"Concluding Statement.To me, I felt that students had the better argument because at the end of the day, it's really all bout what they think and how they feel. They are the having to do these assignments and a certain time, and actually be expected to put everything to the task. For the familes point of view, knowing that their kid can't have the type of summer they want to have because of these summer projects just doesn't sit right in my book. Lastly, but not leastly, the teachers point of view. I completely understand that even during the break, students should still keep their mind focused, in order to prepare for not only the next school year, but the many years to come after that. But, then again this refers back to the students who have to do the work at a not so good time for them. Honestly, I think their should be no work, or assignments given to students during the summer break. It's really not that not worth if the students aren't going to give their 100% best effort to even try to do it. ",1,0,190

7E54AA9ADF2B,"Conclusion.Students would be unaware of the topics related to the course they are going into, for they have not studied it yet. It would be impossible for them to form a beneficial project related to the subject. A teacher could use this project as a precursor to the unit they will study first, beginning to teach right when they get back to school. The students will have some background on the topic, ready to jump in. The students will then be able to have class discussions on the topic, because they all did the same project and are on the same page. For example, Generic_Name is a rising senior in high school going into an American literature class. He is told that he must complete a project over summer. He decides to read a biography on George Washington and do a report on the book. He has no idea that the first unit in the class is poetry. It would have been more beneficial to Generic_Name and the other students in that class if the teacher was able to assign the project. The teacher could have given the students many Edgar Allen Poe poems and assigned a thrilling project to go along with the mysterious and captivating works of Poe. Coming back from summer break, the class could discuss what they read and share their projects with each other. Having a teacher design a relevant project would unify the class and be a wonderful bridge to aid in the transition from summer into a new school year. ",3,2,258
7E54AA9ADF2B,"Conclusion.Some may argue that student-designed projects allow students to have creativity, individuality, and freedom. As a result of these things, students would be more inclined to complete the project; ",2,2,30
7E54AA9ADF2B,"Conclusion.however, these self-assigned projects could easily be swept under the rug, especially in the midst of an exciting summer break. More time, thought, and preparation must go into a student designed project, discouraging students from setting aside appropriate time to devote to the project, because they view it as too challenging.

80031EC3D9B6,"Conclusion.Many believe that automobiles, especially the very popular ""car"", can be very bad for the enviroment. According to the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", it explains how near-record pollution within Paris caused a partial driving ban. This was to help clean the smog infested air in the dense city. Although many delivery companies complained about lost revenue, congestion within the capitcal lowered by 60 percent. By Monday that week, ""the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuesday"". In another article called ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", this one tells how Bogota, Columbia has also banned cars to promote alternate transportation and reduce smog. The ban is only for one day a year (called The Day Without Cars), but it's helped cause the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, new, smoot sidewalks, less traffic, and new restaurants and shopping areas. Business man, Carlos Plaza claims ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" ",3,2,176

83FB519F21F2,"Conclusion.Luke bomberger was just a normal high school graduate, Until his friend Don Reist asked him to go with him to Europe on a cattle boat. He was just given the opportunity of a lifetime. Luke and his friend Don had reasons to sign up for being a "" Seagoing cowboy"". World war II had now ended and many countries were left destroyed, to help the countries recover from war they will need things such as food, animals, and many other things. To help the people in those countries 44 nations united to form a group called UNRRA ( the united nations relief and rehabilitation administration). The "" Seagoing Cowboys"" were hired to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. In August 1945, they got orders to report to New Orleans. Luke and his friend arrived on August 14th, the same day the Pacific war ended. There was 335 horses to take care of. Before arriving in Greece Luke turned 18, which means that he is now eligable to be drafted for the military service. In 1947 Luke had made nine trips, more than any seagoing cowboy. Luke ended up touring many places around the world. Luke was doing his job chcking on the animals, but this time was different it was raining, Luke accidentally slid down a ladder and almost fell into the deep dark ocean but a piece of metal stopped him fromm falling.

This is very unhealthy. An extracurricular activity would get a person who usually plays lots of video games to do something active. They could play sports after school and they would still have time for video games. Playing sports after school could convince them to play sports for fun, not because they have to do something after school and they could join a league and exercise more than just after school.

The Technology Student Association allowed students to be completely in charge of their own work to get a sense of the leadership that is needed in many technology and business fields today.

Student-designed projects allows students to be in control and have the opportunity to manage work responsibly. Even though having a teacher-designed project can help in follow instructions and meeting deadlines, being ones own boss opens doors to many leadership opportunities to excel in the work field, and in ones personal life.

In the food industry, like most jobs, employees must start off with a lower position and must enhance their abilities in order to move up to a higher position. For example, in Panera Bread, most new employees start of working as a cashier, dining room attendant, or produce worker; these minor positions prepare the employee with basic skills and prepare them for future duties. Later, when more experience is gained, employees move up to trainer or manager assistant.

Learning to develop these characteristics is far more important than any history or science lesson their project may be on. As stated earlier, summer projects are usually not followed up on, making students even more likely to forget what they learned about from them.

""The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have been cropped up."" Cities are beggining to cater to the needs of those who don't  use cars. Their negative impact on city streets is finally being recognized, and many are taking action to improve aspects where they live other than roads. In ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the author discusses the goals of the United States and its major figures to reduce total reliance on cars. In this article Bill Ford, executive chairman of Ford Motor Company shares his hopes. ""He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commerical and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected netowork to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" Many are striving to make public spaces more accessable to those who choose more concious methods of transport. ",3,2,244
89A2F3489EC7,"Conclusion.In ""The End of Car Culutre"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal the decreasing numbers of people getting licenses and cars is discussed. ""But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling.

In this article, the disregard full time use of vehichles is also shown. ""The Internet makes telecommunicating possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn epty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work. With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit."" People today can get access to a vehicle on command. Different resources make the constant use of cars unneccesary. ",3,2,185

With the exception of making sure that there would be an activity to match each students interest, the idea would not be too bad. But in the same breath, that'd require some type of survey or application of some type, that every student must take in order to find out their interests, so that way making the activities wont be as difficult. Although keep in mind, that not every student may want to participate regardless of whether or not there is an activity they might enjoy.

8A8B13591181,"Conclusion.After suffering through days of near-record pollution, Paris, France had composed a temporary driving ban in an attempt to clear the air, according to Rober Duffner in ""Paris Bans Driving due to Smog"". The passage goes further to explain that the ban followed five days of smog that rivalled the likes of Beijing, China, which is widely recognized for being one of the most polluted cities in the world. Exceptions to the ban were made for hybrids and cars carrying three or more passengers, and public transportation was made to be free. Once the smog cleared enough, the ban was lifted and citizens were allowed back to the road, but the reduction of auto usage was what saved the air from becoming overly polluted. Moreover, in Bogota, Colombia, citizens participate in a car-free day, entitled Day Without Cars, once a year to reduce smog in the cities, according to ""Car-free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky. Violators are charged with $25 fines, but, according to Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus, the people participate, and the turnouts are large. This day without cars, which has begun to spread to other Colombian cities, is a fantastic way to reduce both air pollution and stress, and is a part of a campaign to oversee the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, which, according to Mayor Mockus, is the most of any city in Latin America.

By using alternative methods of transportation such as trains,buses,taxis,subways, walking and biking we reduce the amount of gas used and also the amount of car emmissons released into the air.

No one wants to do schoolwork over the summer, summer is the time for fun! Allowing students to create a student designed project would create an overall better mindset towards how summer project are viewed. I know that I don't want to do school work over the summer. Giant math packets, books to read, papers to write, it's all so tedious and I always end up pushing it off til August, where I'm then rushing to get it all done in time for the start of school. If I were to be given a project that I could control, it would already seem so much better because I would be in full control over what I did for the project or how I approached a problem I encountered with it.

90212225F733,"Conclusion.Student-designed summer projects may allow students to express their creativity, but can ultimately lead them to learn the information incorrectly. Teachers are guides and resources for students to follow when learning information and asking questions. Frederick Douglass, a slave in the 1800s, became self-educated by looking at other students' papers and reading magazines and books. Although he helped himself become more knowledgable about the world through the new information he obtained, he learned some information wrong because he was not guided or corrected by teachers. Student-designed projects can be precarious because teachers cannot correct students if the project is designed inccorectly. If the project were teacher-designed, then the correct information will be present and learned by the students. The summer projects being flawed can also hurt students. By learning the information incorrectly, they are likely to repeat the same mistakes, making it harder to correct them. In the book

Fish in a Tree , a girl with dyslexia struggled with writing because the words kept moving. She got into the habit of writing letters a specific way so that when a teacher noticed and corrected her, it was hard for her to stop the habit of writing letters incorrectly. Student-designed projects can give students the freedom to express their creativity through learning and designing, but this also allows for students to do their project incorrectly because they learned the material wrong, leading them to repeat the same mistakes because the teacher is not aware of how the students are designing their projects. ",3,2,252
90212225F733,"Concluding Statement.Teacher-designed summer projects can prepare students for the coming year by addressing upcoming subbjects and topics students have previously struggled with. In addition, it prevents students from learning information wrong or doing the project incorrectly by giving them specific guidelines. These projects also ensures that students are challenged and learn new information. Teacher-designed summer projects would be more beneficial for students. ",1,2,63

The robotics team pays around 600 dollars for each robot, and more for the competitions, now that program has to buy 15 robots and buy more slots at the competitions. If some how the schools were able to afford these expensive along with all other clubs, teachers, and staff salaries it would come from our local taxes. This would double our local taxes, but if the schools decide not to over tax the citizens of Generic_School than there would be no way the school could provide the gear and equipment for the school's clubs and teams. My school's sports gear is already worn out and our schools are in dire need of new equipment, but there is no way we could spend 7 times as much just to give everyone more cheap and basic equipment.

95EE2E824EB6,"Conclusion.On most days my dad gets home at around six so when my activity ends at 4:30 in the afternoon i have to take the bus. Currently my school has 2 activity buses, one for Generic_City and one for Generic_City. The activity bus arrives at my home which is 5 miles away at 5:40 in the evening, it takes the bus 1 hour and 10 minutes to drop me off at my home. With a direct route the bus would have to travel at 4 mph. There is no way the school can hire enough buses to work almost 12 straight hours a day. If the school really can't find enough buses each bus would have to make 70 stops. Many students won't be able to be picked up by their parents and will be forced to endure the 3 hour bus ride through a city with only 30 square miles of residential area.

The new district without any cars, has stores and malls in walking distance. so there is no need for a car. Which can save a person lots of money.

People have sold there cars to live in this new district. But if you moved with a car, when you buy a house. And a 40,000 dollar large garage on the edge of the development. The residents also say that not having a car is a lot less to worry about. And the Unite States is promoting car reduced communities.

If students decide to ask a colleague before a teacher, they have the chance of getting incorrect information or no help at all. For example, many students in the AP Computer Science course have to figure out problems of which have many different solution. Students who don't want to give away their specific answer will try to help students figure out a secondary solution. Unfortunately, most students will not be able to figure out a second solution, because they don't have enough experience.

It's not supposed to be hard, the teachers just want he best for you, and have to teach you the schematics for next year or for life. It's similar to parenting, sometimes you have to be harsh to get the point through and the point is to get that student to be well rounded before he/she leaves high school.

He fails to provide any real data or statistics for these things, except when he mentions the simplified electronics in paragraph 7. Even then, those devices are only able to survive for 3 weeks, so it would still take many years to just improve those devices. Also, in paragraph 6 the author states, ""Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus"". This statement is very broad, and it does not key in on any form of information that should lead us to believe that to be true. These details from the passage prove my point on the amount of years it would take, as well as the fact that nobody has any idea how long. The question to be asked here is, ""Is it worth the wait?"".

Exploring Venus proves to be very dangerous, and we have proved that we are no where near being ready for such a task. We would first need to advance our technology for the task. This would take years to due, it would also use up a ton of money, and put people in serious danger. The author did a terrible job of supporting the idea that exploring Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dnagers it presents.

9C95AF195D21,"Conclusion.Subjects including math or science require concepts to be retained because they build off of each other. For example, it is required for students to remember Algebra 1 to succeed in Algebra 2. This sets up students for success so they are not lost when they enter the school year. Going along with that, teachers don't always have enough time in the year to go over forgotten concepts. A lot of school subjects go at a fast pace and have a lot of content to go over. This doesn't allow teachers to go over concepts from prior years. Making school projects student-designed will set up students for success because they have that prior knowledge to build off. When students retain information from the previous year, it gives them confidence when tackling new concepts. Schools try their best to give students confidence so they can perform to the best of their abilities. Their confidence can be damaged when they don't remember concepts from the previous year which goes into learning new subjects. This hinders their ability to succeed in school. Making summer projects student-designed will help them remember past concepts, which will increase student confidence during the school year. ",3,2,199

Their need to be time for students to relax and have fun with friend and family. Their are also a lot of bad things about having summer projects. During the summer your family plans trips and if your doing projects then you cant enjoy the trip. You get to hang out with friends and go to the fair and have fun and get funnel cake.

If you have projects all summer long to do how are you going to go to practice, go to work , and go on trips your family panned. How are teacher going to give us projects if we wouldnt know how to do it. We wouldnt know the classes we would be in and how to work the problem out and solve it. You get to hang out with friends and go to the fair and have fun and get funnel cake. Family's have a lot to do during the summer and having projects would mess all the plans up for the summer.

9E3A10CC0A72,"Conclusion.In Pre-Advanced Placement World History, students were required to plan, create, and execute an entire project based off of a topic of their choice relating to world history and present it to the class. It was expected that students would create said project at an Advanced Placement level skill set, that did not go as planned. Students would come into class during work days and do absolutely nothing, treating the block like a study hall, and when it came time to present projects, they had next to nothing, or something that could be done by a sixth grader. Students did not take the assignment seriously and could not be trusted to create projects or assignments on their own. When asked why the poor outcome of the project, students protested with arguments of how it was their assignment to design and how it was unfair of teachers to judge them on their skill set for that even though the real reason was them slacking off to still get a grade; therefore, it is out of question whether or not students should be able to create assignments for themselves, let alone be trusted with the task.

To do this, many schools are adopting mandatory summer projects for students to complete before their next school year will begin. These projects will stimulate critical thinking and sharpen the skills that students have learned in their previous year.

Due to this, students will face a smooth transition from their prior grade to their next. Additionally, by making these projects student designed, the projects will not interfere in their day to day activities during the summer and will provide assignments that will efficiently target students' weak areas and strengthen them.

They are finding out ways too make electronics go onto venus because there is a lot of danger if we put a human on venus 170 dagrees is too hot for the human body unless they got the blimp at freezing tempatures the people inside will burn righht up blood will boil and people will get heat strokes. But if we put electronicson the planet that can survive the tempatures we might not have a problem with people being burned alive and we could actually exploer the lands of Venus we could make vheacles out of strong silicone for this mission it would be easier too make vehicle out of the stuff. ,3,1,172

In the first elace why would you want anyone in the vehicle to operate a phone in the vehicle which could become a distraction to the driver and everyone who's in the video. To me that extremely dangerous because if you didn't know in today's society everyone likes to use their phone while in the vehicle. Phones shouldn't be even be thought about while in the vehicle because that's how most accidents happen because of distracted drivers. Which is basically a second distraction to drivers. Just say your phone rings while your driving so you take your eyes off the road to see who's calling is intensively increasing your risk for an accident. ",3,0,131

A4ADCC04C319,"Concluding Statement.
Summer projects should be teacher-designed because they know how to motivate and advise students. Teachers are always seen as inspirations because of all that they do.

A4E6E2D5658D,"Conclusion.Students may have a difficult time choosing a topic, method, or creation needed to design an assignment, especially because teachers have given the students topics and requirements necessary the entire year, so students never acquired the skill for creating assignments.

Also, there is the possibility that students don't want to create their own assignment and want to stick to the teacher's book.

Teacher instructions on assignments are usually clear and straight forward, which could be a lot easier for a student to understand.

By stating that ""a vehicle hovering over Venus"" would be safe for humans and then directly stating that it would not be enough and that scientists who want useful information would have to ""get up close and personal despite the risks"", the author states conflicting ideas.

In addition, earlier in the passage the author states ""On the planet's surgace, temperatures average over 800 degrees""(3).

AD3FFB7CA387,"Conclusion.""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" (Duffer 10). This states that the air has been getting so polluted that some cities have been temporarily banning the use of cars because of this issue. Earth has been getting too polluted and destroyed lately, to the point that some people have been trying to predict an ""end is nigh"" date due to all of these issues with earth. Scientists have been talking about global warming for years now, and the problems we have been having with the greenhouse effect and the ozone layer. ""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.""

AFCE5307F69A,"Conclusion.When a student designs their own project, there are very few restrictions applied. This is good because the students can learn required content however they want to, and they will most often choose to learn it in a way that is effective for them, which a teacher can't always provide. There is the argument that teachers can just give students a variety of options to choose from with a project, and that that freedom in choice will help students learn in a way beneficial to them but unfortunately that just isn't the case. Many students never get to create a project that they actually want to make, and teachers often just repeat options over and over again that students are already familiar with. For example, what if a teacher just kept giving out the same current events question, and a student never got to answer the question they were actually interested in? The freedom in designing a project allows a student to actually want to learn content, since they choose a way to learn content that would be fun to them. ",3,2,182

That is why extracurricular activities are a great option, they are provided by the school. Extracurricular activities are cost efficient and parents do not have to pick/drop of their kids. Most schools provide an after school bus. ",3,0,60
B095598DEE04,"Conclusion.Humans can often acknowledge how they are feeling, but the acknowledgement itself does not allow them to feel better. As stated in the article, ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one"" (D'Alto 7). This line states that the lab partner will be able to tell a difference netween a genuine and meaningful smile from a harshly forced smile. There is a difference between the two because smiling will not make you happy although it is a happy gesture. The machine informing someone that they need to smile will not actually change the emotions of that person. Politicians and celebrities are major culprits of this action. They often smile as they are told to do, but they are not always genuine. They are typically hiding something from their spectators such as when they are not being truthful (D'Alto 8). Just because famous people smile when talking or looking at their audience does not change whether or not they are happy individuals. If humans themselves are unable to change their emotions when they can detect that something is wrong, then machines will be unable to do that also. Although it can give people a precise measurement of their emotions, it will not change how they feel. Therefore, investing in this system would be extremely useless and wasteful. ",3,2,222

As it was passing over a strip of Mars called Cydonia, it snapped a picture that would cause an uproar in space exploration. This new picture showed what seemed to be a human face. A few days later NASA reveled these pictures for the world to see; it was an instant hit ",4,2,77

B0CCFA21F82C,Conclusion.The reason why we need to have friends and be more comfortable around people is because friends are always a important part of a persons life. Comfort is also really important because most jobs involve people and if you're uncomfortable around people that could be a problem. ,3,0,48
B0CCFA21F82C,Conclusion.Having fun is very important because we are still young and still deserve to have fun doing the stuff we love with the people we love. If we aren't having any fun as a young person we most likely won't have very much fun older. Not having could lead to sadness which isn't a good thing. It also gives us motivation to get through the day because we know at the end of the day we get to do the thing we love most. ,3,0,85
B0EA4F7B076C,"Conclusion.The author talks about different stuff how our sister plant is so inhospitable"". Scientists also see and search what's going on in the world and in the planets. I think it's good that we know some of these stuff so we know in the future that can happen. ",3,0,49
B0EA4F7B076C,"Conclusion.The solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed earth levels. Also says in paragraph 5 that's not easy conditions, but survivable for humans. Venus from a ship orbiting or havering safely far above. There is different facts about everything. ",3,1,43
B0EA4F7B076C,Conclusion.For the last paragraph it should be about how the world is working now. In paragraph 8 striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus. There should be limits by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination. Imagine exposing the cellphone and all that. ,3,1,52
B0EB441FDE3A,"Conclusion.No, none of these land formations were man made!

They are formed naturally by nature.

Now over the years we have found a lot of reasons how Mars is sort of like the earth.

It carries water, and it is one of the easiest planets to get to, so if you think about it, Mars could have the same land formations as we do!

Nature is a beautiful thing, and it more than likely made this so called ""face"". ",3,0,80

You are going off of a guess in your mind. ",6,1,17
B0EB441FDE3A,"Concluding Statement.So overall in this essay I have covered three thing.

I have covered my first argument, which is that we have not found aliens even though we have been searching all of these years.

I have covered my second argument, which is that nature has formed many structures like this on earth, it could have been formed out of the land.

And I also covered the rebuttle, which is that there is a possibility that this was built by aliens because we have found traces.

So in conclusion, this structure was not built by humans, this was land made. ",1,0,101

B181B21A4FA6,"Conclusion.There were a lot of failed missions to the moon and now look what we know about it. We learned so much because people decided to risk their lives in order for us to learn more about the universe. We can do so much good with the world and if we have the choice of trying to go to Venus, shouldn't we try? The only way we know we're going to fail is if we don't try and not trying would be a diservice to people. ",3,0,87
B1F07D72CCB4,Conclusion.In this sitiuation We're trying to convience people and tell them that aliens has nothing to do with this. ,6,0,20
B1F07D72CCB4,"Conclusion.Reasons that I would conclude is, as scientists research it is just a landform. Scientists also says that its just another Martian mesa. It's related to the red planet Cydonia. As the one scientist took it among himself and took the picture alot of times just to get a great angle of it everyone was waiting for it. Even web surfers this was a huge impact on the people believing that it was a alien.

B216794ACCCA,"Conclusion.In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author thinks studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers, but does not support this idea very well. ",5,2,30
B216794ACCCA,"Conclusion.Not only does the author describe why dangers are present on the planet Venus, but they also gives analogies in regards to the danger present ",0,0,26
B216794ACCCA,Conclusion.The author tries to justify the dangers by explaining technology that will be used in order to allow individuals to study Venus. ,0,0,23
B216794ACCCA,"Conclusion.The author describes, ""a vehicle hovering over Venus"" (paragraph 5). At first, the technological advances that could be made sound like a good idea, but the author goes on to say how, ""tempertaures would still be toasty at around 170 degress Fahrenheit"" (paragraph 5). This fact completely shuts down the idea of the hovering vehicle. The author contradicts their ideas by explaining the dangers in depth and giving reason as to why studying Venus is not a good idea. ",3,2,80
B2426E4674E7,"Conclusion.Studying Venus seems almost impossible with all the risks, but the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggests that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite all the dangers it presents. ",4,2,32
B2426E4674E7,Conclusion.The author certainly proves their idea on why they think studying the planet Venus is worth it. The author supports their idea by making sure to back it up with evidence. ,5,2,32
B2426E4674E7,"Conclusion.To illistrate, ""...human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"" (8). The author explains how humans are naturally curious, and how this curiosity often times leads them to dangerous situations. Studying Venus has its dangers, but it is no different. Also stated, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"" (8). The author is promoting curiosity because it leads us to new things. Curiosity can overcome the fear of danger when exploring Venus to help us learn new things about the planet. To summarize, the power of curiosity in people is something the author uses to support their opinion of Venus being worth it to explore. ",3,2,130
B2426E4674E7,"Conclusion.For example, ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Farenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth"" (5). The author uses this piece of evidence to demonstrate that Venus's conditions are possible for humans to survive, making Venus a serious contendor for space exploration. ",3,2,60
B24EE1A93A0B,Conclusion.After all would you decide to help out and figure out more about Venus? Scientist are doing a great job so far with everything they are figuring out about what could be more helpful to them. They also know that is can be safe for them to hover over Venus instead of landing on it and having a horrible tragidy. ,5,1,61

B3176BB24009,"Conclusion.With this in mind, the idea that using Facial Action Coding Systems in classrooms would be valuable is not only true, but something that should be acted upon. (D'Alto). ",5,2,30
B3176BB24009,"Conclusion.In the life of someone that is attending school, there is one idea that is always looming over their shoulder. Whether it be like a cloud on a rainy day or a shadow following them on a sunny one, grades are always an important factor in a school-goer's life. ",3,0,50
B3176BB24009,"Conclusion.As science is an ever-budding field by it's own nature, there is no reason that a new technology wouldn't thrive among those interested in both science and technology. ",3,2,29
B3176BB24009,"Conclusion.Therefore, as this is something that is new and up and coming, the addition of this to clasrooms may spark a pasion for this subject and inspire a career to form. ",0,2,32
B3176BB24009,"Concluding Statement.As kids are ever-subject to new and upcoming ideas, it is evident that the addition of recent techology could aid their progression in school and would be deemed as important and valuable to include. If a kid were someone that easily lost interest in a course or was not very interested in a certain class, they may then be more provoked to learn and pay attention if this new technology was included at their school and interested them. By doing so, there is potential that the student would then be able to improve their grade and get much out of this porgram. Also, if a student were to be even intrigued in this technology, there could be potential for this studen to go into a job field that dealt with this type of technology as there are many that vary greatly in doing so. Overall, the inclusion of present innovations and technology should be including the next generations, as success for them now will lead to future success for all. ",1,2,172
B3388EF1E80C,"Conclusion.Despite the benefits of student-designed projects, those who favor ones designed by teachers point to the fact that teachers can base projects off the curriculum students will have to learn during the school year and thus help students feel more prepared. ",2,2,42
B3388EF1E80C,"Conclusion.Additionally, teachers who are focused solely on the curriculum may end up assigning a project that students do not understand due to a lack of prior knowledge needed to complete the project. Students can pick a part of the curriculum they may already have some background knowledge about to create a project that will help them take an in-depth look at something they will be learning more about ",3,0,69
B3388EF1E80C,"Conclusion.Thus, it is possible for students to create a project that addresses important parts of the material they will learn ",0,2,21
B3388EF1E80C,"Conclusion.Teachers do not know the experiences of the students they are designing projects for, so they may create one that students struggle applying their real-world knowledge to or one that only focuses on the curriculum instead of ways the learning material can be applied to life outside of school. Students can find creative ways to link what they learn in school to its applications in the real world. This better prepares students for their future lives and careers, where they will be applying what they learned in school instead of being continually tested on it. These students are more prepared for what they will be doing after they finish their education because of this prior experience in applying their knowledge and experience. This also reminds students that there is a world outside of school, creating worldly citizens who are able to apply what they learned to solving problems. ",3,2,149
B3388EF1E80C,"Conclusion.Students can be assured that they will have a project that they can complete when they design their own project, instead of one that may be too challenging or that they might not have the resources to complete. ",0,2,39
B3388EF1E80C,"Concluding Statement.Students should design summer learning projects because they can create more interesting ways to learn, they can design ways to incorporate their real-world experiences to the academic curriculum, and they can make a project that will not be too difficult for them to complete over summer break. Students can design more engaging projects based on their interests that will ultimately increase benefits such as higher standardized tests scores and retention of material. Their ability to design projects that incorporate the curriculum into the real world will better prepare them for life and work after they complete their education. In school districts where summer projects are used, parents should advocate for student-designed projects to better their children's education. ",1,2,119
B371C925A2B2,Conclusion.sometines you just don't know wehn that person is feeling happy or sad as it states in the passage 5 ''You can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her/his face '' and the new technology can help you read their emotions the way they are feeling .Another reason why it can help on students with the new technolongy by the imagine as it states in passage 6 and just by the imagine the computer will know when you are happy or sad .This can help us by helping them out and for them not to feel that way becasue sometimes when student's get mad they do thing they know should't do but all that sadness or anger can take them over by casuing harm .As it will be nice to stop the harm from someone doing it. Another example is this Wed ad as stated in the passage 6 as well now this wed can see your other emotions as an example .''If you smile when a wed ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow .But if you frown the next ad will be different ,3,0,195
B371C925A2B2,"Conclusion.when I see them walking around with there face down or just seeing them happy .Like for example lets say that I am walking around the hall way and see my freind wih a serious face or just them not talking to I will like to use the technolgy and see what is wrong with them and try to help them out with the feeling they have and just try to change their mood .Another reason why I will like to help is by seeing how does my mom feel when she looks at me like just take a picture of her and see what are the emotion she has or as in passage say in 7 an ''encode ''different emotions like make her look at her self in the mirror and follow the steps it say and see what are the emotion she has. But yes the technology ''The Facial expressio for each emotion are universal ''because it can help out in many awlays 
",3,0,166
B37E64E1BE1E,"Conclusion.For me I'm not okay by techonology called the Facial Action System because that can't tell that you can describe people's emotion, ",5,0,23
B37E64E1BE1E,"Conclusion.For me i think we're the only one and are family who can tell what's are emotion we can't also tell what's other's people emotions and also if you really don't know that person you can't really say or red what's their emotions. Like example even we smile in front of people that doesn't express that we're really happy etc because sometimes people smile because they don't want to see other people's worrying for them so they're just choosing to smile in front of them. Like me sometime's if im with other people even l'm sad or angry, l don't what to show what's my real emotion because l'm just choosing to smile in front of them because i don't want them to worry about my emotion or something. The only people who can read or tell what's are emotion is no other than are parents because they know us better than other people. We been on their tummy for nine months so they are the only one who can really read or tell what are emotion.

B40DD5822E7E,Concluding Statement.I honestly disagree with this decision because there could be a kid or a select group of kids that like to start fights or want to harm other students.

Teachers should designed summer projects that could be work with other people, they should make it fun. Summer projects should be fun but yet the students can still be learning. Projects do not have to be boring all the time. They should make it about getting up,doing some movements. When students are doing these projects they should be walking, running, laughing, talking, and working with one another. If teachers make these summer projects boring students may want to do them. Is also their summer where they have fun, where they go to vacations with their families, where they go to the pool, the beach. Summer is basically their free time, their free month, no school.

B5CA9C10711C,"Conclusion.However, lowering the difficulty of a project doesn't cause a dramatic shift in student participation. As seen in several classrooms, in regards to homework, regardless of the difficulty in the assignment, many student willingly choose to not complete their assignment. Therefore, attendance or participation is an irrelevant factor when designing these projects. ",6,2,53

B6B2D2FC8F3D,"Conclusion.Many schools offer a variety of extracurricular activities that students can participate in. Although many students are recognized for all of the activities they do, some of their fellow students do not participate in any. There are many excuses children and teens come up with as to why they can't participate, but there are a couple logical reasons that support their case. ",4,0,63

B6B2D2FC8F3D,"Conclusion.If you are involved in sports there are many expenses that come with the honor. You have to buy the right shoes and clothes to practice in, but that's not all. Getting training lessons for the activity can be very expensive and a hard task to achieve. Also, their parents might want to use the money for other things that are important to them like a family vacation, or eating out. Lastly, they may be participating in an activity out of school that is expensive, and having to pay for both a school activity, and after school activity can be difficult. ",3,2,102
B6B2D2FC8F3D,"Conclusion.Some parents work late so finding a ride home or getting everything prepared for the activity can be hard. Also, a lot of students work on homework after school, if they played a sport or participated in a club, they may not have enough time to accomplish their studies, which in my opinion is the most important task of all. Students may not manage their time wisely. Finishing homework, participating in an activity, and still having a little free time at the end of the day is a lot to juggle. Without unlimited time on your hands, he or she may feel overwhelmed and stressed, which can lead to bigger problems. ",3,2,112
B6B2D2FC8F3D,"Concluding Statement.although I would respect the principal's ultimate decision, I disagree with her statement. Students should not have to be involved in an extracurricular activity. They should be able to choose if they want to participate in an activity. Ultimately, the students choice should be prioritized, because they know their own strengths, and there are a couple reasons to support my claim.

B6F03D0CEABE,"Concluding Statement.Schools have to understand students better. With summer based projects being designed by the students they are able to have some fun doing it while also learning skills that are needed for both in school and out. Doing so helps them learn how to be independent and makes it so teachers will let them as well. So I do think that summer projects should be made by the students, because it helps them to learn independence, know when to take a break, and then let teachers know that they can do it but a little help at the start doesn't hurt.  ",1,2,103

B8757E80EB9D,"Conclusion.how are we supposed to study it when it just keeps destroying our spacecrafts. We haven't tried it again in a decade. The reason to this is that Temperatures vary around 800 degrees fahrenheit. Venus has a thick atmosphere of 97% carbon dioxide. If us humans even take a step on Venus we get crushed. Venus has a 90% atomic pressure, which is greater than what we have on Earth. It could even crush a submarine and those are supposed to outstand pressure from the ocean.

They are also too busy thinking about their responses and what to say to pay attention to other drivers on the road. Since it usually takes two hands to text, the drivers have no hands on the steering wheel. This distraction causes the most fatalities.

B884018E887C,"Conclusion.A boy named luke that graduated for high school and had worked two part time jobs in a grocery store . His friend had ask him if he wanted to go to Europe on a cattle boat ,luke said yes he said he couldnt have said no beacuse he doesnt like saying no to people. And he also said that it was a oportunity of a lifetime. It was 1945, world war ll was over in Europe, and many countries were left in runis . And too hope that those familys recover on food and animals. Then there were sign ups for a UNRRA Seagoing Cowboy and so Luke and Don sign up for it .In August 14,1945 ,'' Luke said , the day the Pacific war ended.'' they got their seaman's paper and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster , headed for Greece- with a cargo of 335 ho rsees plus enough hay and oats feed them . L uke turned 18 before arriving in Greeece , which meant he he could be draft ed gfor military service.

When my draft board learned that i was on a cattle- boat trip , they h ad told me to just keep doing t hat for my service . 'by the time he was discharged in 1947 , Luke had mde trips - the mast of any saegoing cowboy. The cattle boat trip were an unbelivable oppportunity fo ra smalll towm boy,; he said , besides helping people , I had the side benefit of seein of seeeing Eurpe and China.

B90C8C40C0A0,"Conclusion.Summer projects purpose is to continue the growth of your mind when you are out of the classroom for about 90 days. A lot can happen to adolescents over the summer, a lot of things that anyone who is not in the same phase of life can truly understand. Many teenagers find sanity with their peers and friends in this time frame of growing up. As seen and extensively studied by Erik Erikson, Erikson came to the consensus that when you are going through the school-age stage of life you begin to pull away from your parents and adults to find yourself and find your independence. In result, you grow more drawn to your friends and peers, due to them understanding the phase of development you are going through. The connection students have with each other is something that can not be matched by teachers. No matter the background or clique a student is in they all have one major characteristic in common that connects them, they are all students. Teachers have not been in school in years and they don't connect with the same things as this generation does. Teachers did not have the same technology, pop culture, or even the same societal standards as today students have. ",3,2,210
B90C8C40C0A0,"Conclusion.The creativity of generation Z is outstanding and unique to modern day society. The opportunity for students to create the projects would be extraordinary and expressive of our generation. The use of creativity is very limited in school. You are to be complacent with the standards of your school through the strict rules and regulations they place. Many of the rules you are given are not only rigid but not needed. Teachers set boundaries on students and rarely let them experience and express their own style and flair. When students are allowed to indulge in their personal ambiance their limits are endless. This is embodied through art and the publishing of students in modern day. More books written by teenagers are selling on the shelves today, than ever before. ",3,2,130

B94059412B2C,"Conclusion.If we take an extra course, there might not be enough time to finish all our homework. When I get home, I have a substantial amount of homework to do, and I have to practice the sports I play. My schedule is already full. homework takes me the longest to do. I work on my homework thoroughly. I try to make sure there isn't any mistakes. When I do this, I'm more likely to pass the test because of how much thought and time I have put into my work. I describe this as my work ethic. My homework takes me about two to four hours at most and it takes up most of my schedule. The sports that I play take two hours. With a total of seven hours at most, I can never seem to fit anything else in my schedule. This might be surprising for other people but this is the daily schedule for average students and most students might have more to do. If we even tried to do an extra activity than we wouldn't be able to finish all of our work efficiently and properly. Adding another thing to do every day would throw off our work ethic and our grades would most likely go down. Time has such a drastic effect on us students because it can be hard to manage. Our parents, for example, suffer from time management along with us. If we all do an extra activity, then that means that school is extended another few minutes. This is hard for our parents who pick us up after school. They have to find another time to pick us up which can be stressful since their schedule is as cramp as ours. We are not able to participate in an extra curriculum because of the amount of time that we don't have, and even if we were able to, there might not be any other options. ",3,2,324

BB5B7EE4A1A6,"Conclusion.Many student grow up always being told what to do and how to do it. This does not allow for any creativity or original thoughts to be generated all by ones self. For example, when I was a child, my parents would lay out clothes each morning for me to wear to school. Not only did this limit my creativity, it also limited my self identity because I was unable to express myself in what clothes I wear. This so called favor that my parents would do for me caused me to never learn how to dress myself in a reasonable fashion for the appropriate setting. Just like how the students will never know how to design their own projects if the teachers do not put any faith in the students for just this one summer. The teachers will be able to see a students best representation of his or hers creativity and level of learning because they will have something to prove to society. To show everyone that they are able to do things on their own or independently ",3,2,181
BB5B7EE4A1A6,"Conclusion.The students need to have the teachers and society's trust to exceed what is expected of them because society will never know what these students are capable of if they are never given an opportunity to prove themselves.

So Luke let people from other places stay at his home so they could go to a good school. And that awarness stayed with him for the rest of his days. Like he said it was an opportunity of a life time.

Luke had just graduated from high school and was working 2 part time jobs. One at the bank. One at the grocery. Untill one day his friend Don Reist came along and asked him to be a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" with him. He knew this was the oppertunity of a life time. So obivisly he went.

In August 1995, World War ll was over in Europe, many countries were gone. So luke and the other Seagoing Cowboys were sent there with food, animals, and more. Luke and his friend were shiped over seas to help as part of the UNRRA. He was shocked to see all the countries ruined. There was nothing left!

After all of that he was shiped to China with lots of suplies. One his way he got to see ols castles. He also traveled down the Panama Canal. The aniamls keep Luke very busy. They needed to be feed 3 times a day. They played lots of ball games to pass the time. Like volleyball and table tennis.

Being a

Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure to Bomberger. On all over his nine missions he learned that he was very lucky. LIke he said,""It made me more aware of people of other countries and thier needs."" And the awareness stayed with him, he became a host for international students and exchage visitors for many years. That oppertunity chaged Luke Bomberger's live forever!

BFC824D7C408,"Conclusion.Students become boxed in boundaries due to the pressure of doing things a certain way and learning the way teachers tell them to. When students can design projects and learn in a way they believe is beneficial, learning becomes less of pressured task and more of a way to explore one's horizon. One thing students struggle with the most when completing assignments and projects is constant pressure. Students do not have the ability to express their ideas because they have to stick to an exact rubric. One of example of this is a science expo; many teachers tell the students what they should do for the project and don't give the students time to think about what interests them. This pressure of another voice constantly in their head makes learning and expression of ideas a struggle. In order for students to reach their full potential, they should be able to design in a way they are not boxed by others. ",3,2,161

However, as children get older, students increasingly have to make a larger commitment to learning and school. This often takes the form of more homework and projects during the school year, but also utilizes the extensive freedom and free time of the summers to keep students up to speed with their academics and prepare them for the next year.

C0E94C60E7C5,"Conclusion.In this new approach to limit car usuage stores are placed a walk away on a main street,rather than in malls along some distant highway. even in the united states the enviromental protection agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously.

for example congestion went down in france after five days not being to drive and of intensifiying smog.70 percent of vaubans families do not own cars,and 57 percent  sold a car to move here. most people are happier with the the car usage limit due to that fact that they have too be tense anymore. and the wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

Vauban,home to 5,500 people wihtin a rectangular square mile , is the most advanced experiment in low-car sudan surburban. many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a six year federal transportation bill to be approved this year.

New suburbs may look more vauban-like,not only in developed countries but also in developing world,vauban,germany residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers,going where few soccer moms or commuting excutives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars .

When working online with emotions. When it's online it not how it done. The computer is doing with what some people want.

C44A40CDFF3A,"Conclusion.For instance, much of the work we are assigned in school is teacher-designed. From personal experience, when a project is teacher-designed, a lot of the work can be mediocre, as apposed to a project that is student-designed. When students aren't allowed to come up with their own ideas, their imagination is bound and restricted. Some teachers may argue that it doesn't matter that students are restricted, all that matters is that a student gets the work done, but that is not correct. The student wont be as motivated and will turn in a project that is has no effort, therefore getting a lower grade. ",3,2,105
C4C3A58C5939,"Conclusion.Since venus is so close to it makes it the second hottest planet in space. Its hard for them to examine it closely because how hot it could be on the planet so the sit safe at a certain vantage point.

Venus is close to earth witch makes itthe twin like in terms of density and size its close but distant a little from venus. So say if we get close to the sun earth woukd basically be like venus. Venus and earth is right around the corner from eachother so wat makes it different from eachother shouldnt the earth be hot too. To really think about it hot would it be if we were like venus.

The atmosphere is 97 perdent of carbon dioxide blankets venus which could really explain where the heat come from or take place in. Theres acid in venus atmosphere the pressure is 90 times worst than what it would usally be on earth. Its over 800 degress on that plante which makes it a baby sum or the son of sun. Venus has one if the worst tempature ever it gets so hot that it woukd kill us humans in a instant if we think about it. ",3,0,204

C51752A9035C,"Concluding Statement., even if teacher designed projects could also be beneficial to a certain group of students, the knowledge being given to the students mind won't make as much of an impact as a student designed project would. People tend to forget that not all teenagers come from the same mentality of not being hard workers or not smart enough, every person in this world has their own intelligence within themselves, people just tend to forget and start to believe that they don't have a smart mentality. If teachers can have enough trust in their students and be willing to ask them for help, then that should be a sign that summer projects can be student designed. Therefore, if there are not enough teachers who can help make the projects for students in the summer, then students can try to help with that if they want to. ",1,0,147

Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking land on it's surface. If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface? Astronmers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of a rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains and craters. ",3,1,135

C7FA88E9DF3B,"Conclusion.When students are assigned teacher-designed projects, they are not usually excited to work on the assignment. Additionally, they do not value it as important, leaving the work until the last minute. For example, in 7th grade, my Life Science class was assigned a project about the deer population in Virginia. Many of the students did not actively work on the project, as they found the topic boring. Because they did not understand the relevance of the topic, the students were not passionate about the project. An independent project assigned in my AP Lang class, however, had a different result. The assignment was to write a research paper on a social issue that interested us. Because students were able to write about an issue that interests them, they actively worked on the project. Being passionate about a project also affects a student's performance in class. For example, because the majority of the class was not passionate about the deer project, they did not do well on it. However, on the AP Lang assignment, the majority of the class did well on related assignments, as they were passionate about the projects they worked on. ",3,2,193

All of these statements and claims that the author make support his/her claim that the exploration of Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it entails as they are quite literally explaining to their readers why exploration is as important as it is.

CE120A8B4336,"Conclusion.This means there is a worthy reason to explore Venus; to discover another habitable planet. Along with successful life on Venus, our modern technology could also survive the planet. Paragraph 5 states, ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground codnitions by staying up and out of their way"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Moreover, if airplanes are already in existence, new aircrafts would need to be slightly adjusted to suit the conditions of Venus.

CE94B3F26D2F,"Conclusion.to insure students are expanding their learning throughout the summer, teachers should be the ones to design the summer projects. ",0,2,21
CE94B3F26D2F,"Conclusion.They are the teachers and have gone through elementary, middle and high school just as most people have. But, they have also gone to college in order to be a teacher. They have learned specific material in which they need to know to become a teacher, regardless of the school. They have already have gone through their studies and have mastered the material. As students you are just now learning things as you grow and develop. To better understand, teachers go to school much longer than student to make sure that they know what they are doing and that they are able to teach the material to all different kinds of students. They know what we need to know and want to help prepare us for the new year abroad. Now if the students were to choose the project then they could possibly choose a subject in which is completely wrong and not needed for the following year to help you learn. ",3,2,163
CE9EB0366069,"Concluding Statement.Learning does not stop at the end of high school, and it certainly does not stop at the end of a school year. Student-designed projects allow for creativity and individualism from each and every student, and allowing teachers to have a guiding-but not controlling-hand in the projects can lead to fantastic academic results.  ",1,2,55

CF1345B5E224,"Conclusion.""All of our development since World war 2 has been centered on car,and that will have to change"" said David goldberg, an official of transportation for America. but nothing has gotten better since all this years. pollution of greenhouse gases in the uk are up to 12 percent and in the united states an estimate of atleast 50 percent in most car intensive areas. Mr. goldberg also stated ""how much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid"" which is also something that is not taken into account.

In paris there had a offical ban from drving your cars, people who were caught driving cars were fined up to 22-euro($31).Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emisssions. Caris typically has more smog than other european capitals with paris having up to 147 micro grams of particulate matter (pm) per cubic meter compared with 114 in brussels and 79.7 in london, reuters found. Congestion was down 60% after just five-days of intensifying smog which even rivaled places such beijing and china.

As a matter of fact, if you happen to be struggling with any particular subject having teacher-designed projects is more helpful and significant hence you are attaining help and directions from a professional person who understands what they are doinig as well as what you need help on a much higher level that outstand that of a student-designed one. That being said, a teacher-designed summer project is a perfect way to continue learning because you are not only being assisted by getting extra help on a specific assignment, but you are getting more knowledge and benefiting your education even when you are not in school. In other words, you are learning from your mistakes by fixing them with the right tools you need through your teacher and that results in you being more confident and comfortable on that very topic or project you had issues with in the first place. Indeed, getting extra help from you teacher will help you get better grades and following a well teacher-designed summer project will put you in good position for working hard and working on your communication skills as well as keeping your brain sharp and training it to endure any complex situations such as making sure you complete any due work and homework on time.

D18B9F0D2CB4,"Conclusion.In the German suburb of  Vauban, citizens have given up their cars. A resident there says ""when i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (3). Limiting car use also limits the frequency of trafic jams, accidents, and unfriendly drivers in a hurry along with the stress and frustration that accompany them. In Colombia's capital, Bogata, the Day Without Cars has had many participants. One of whom said ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress"" referring to the event. (24) limiting stress can have major benefits to a persons health and mental well-being. limiting the use of cars does'nt just positivly effect mental health, it can positivly influence physical health. In Bogata, Colombia, the car-free day inspired residents to ""hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work "" (20). Excersize releases endorphins which are chemicals in the brain related to pleasure. Many people that excersize regularly are happier then when they don't. By limiting car usage,citizens are more inspired to excersize making them happier and healthier. ",3,2,174

There is a boy at my school that we are going to call Generic_Name. Generic_Name does not understand the WWI subjets in his history class. He's been doing his class and homework, been paying attention, he's been writing his notes, but he still does not understand the subject. He's asked his teacher for extra help and has recieved it. While his knowledge for the unit is growing, he still just barely passes his Standards of Learning test with a 401. Over the summer, his school required all students to make up their own project about anything they may have learned. At first he did not think it was going to help him but he decides to give it a try anyway. Generic_Name decides that if he has to learn about something over summer, he might as well learn about something he's been having trouble with.

D228AB564BF6,"Conclusion.Summer assignments have to be short, sweet, and efficient, or they will lose the student, potentially for the entire school year. ",0,2,22
D228AB564BF6,"Conclusion.Students should be able to pick a topic for a standard project, like a short PowerPoint or a poster presentation, where students can go hands on while learning. Those history packets would be much more involving to me if they had to do with the World Wars or Military history, and even more if they involved some sort of project component. Disinterest also causes students to be less likely to complete summer assignments. I know of plenty of students, that just won't turn in the project or assignment if they don't want to do it. Summer of Junior year, my class had an essay to write about a current political issue. Half of the class turned in that assignment on time because they just didn't want to do it or were plainly uninterested. Summer Assignments need to be like those A+ introductions to essays, they need to grab the reader and hook them into the topic early, or in the case of summer assignments, they need to interest the student so they keep going and are hooked for the year.

D228AB564BF6,"Concluding Statement.The only way for a project students like to be made, you have to consult the students. Politicians in democratic governments don't guess what the voters want, they ask what the voters want. If teachers are trying to build something for the students, ask the students, it's simple. If teachers want more interest in a course, better grades, more students willing to work, more participants in class, or better summer projects, the only way to do so is to let the students design the assignment.

D3D2660F2D77,"Conclusion.Using a motor vehicle as a source of transportation is part of everyday life and is not rare to the stereotypical American. But cities such as Paris, Bogota, and Vauban are all striving towards reducing the rate of motor vehicle usage in their areas. ",4,0,45
D3D2660F2D77,"Conclusion.Transportation is the second largest source of America's emmisions and is responsible for fifty percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States but is slowly making a change towards helping the enviornment and being beneficial towards carbon emissions. In 2005, the number of miles driven in the United States was at it's highest rate. As time went by, the numbers started dropping and getting lower. Many sociologits believe that if the numbers get even lower and stay at that rate, the benefits will come for the enviornment but unfortunetly not for car companys. Paris typically has more smog than any other European capital and is working towards a way to fix that. Paris banned driving due to the intensity and abundance of the smog in their city and had people use public transportation free of charge for about a week. Not using motor vehicles for those days really did help the situation of Paris and gave people an insight as to how life would be without cars. ",3,2,169
D3D2660F2D77,"Conclusion.Vauban, an upscale community in Germany, is home to suburban pioneers who have given up their cars. Seventy percent of Vauban's family do not own cars and fifty-seven percent sold a car to move there. ""Smart planning"" is a component of the movement to seperate suburban life from auto use to create a denser and more compact enviornment and let people be more accesssible to public transportation. This means less space for parking, and more stores compactly placed and at short distances. In Bogota, ""Car-free day"" is part of an improvement campaign which helps residents of the city to see how life is life without the use of cars for a day. People use public transportation and walk to their destinations with no problem. More parks and sport centers have also been added to the area as a result of less car usage, so more space for other important things.

D4E3104E7591,"Conclusion.To assure students are continuing to learn over the summer, some schools assign summer projects. ",4,0,16
D4E3104E7591,"Conclusion.A school summer project should be teacher designed even though it puts more work onto a teachers part, but it is better than getting poor projects from confused students in the beginning of a school year. ",5,2,37
D4E3104E7591,"Conclusion.With guide lines already set up, the student can continue forth and begin the project successfully. Let us say it was a textbook reading and project based on the reading. Students, for the most part, do not generally enjoy reading pages on pages on pages; however, if a teacher gives a blank statement about what to do, the readings become difficult for the student to comprehend. In a students mind, it can go many different ways to think about a project. Having a teacher design a project base gives the student more to go off of instead of a teacher saying ""Read these pages and submit a project by the beginning of the school year"" is not helpful. By giving a foundation of the project, the student can succeed and be more efficient. ",3,2,134
D4E3104E7591,"Conclusion.Also, student based projects have a variety of choices and decisions on whether or not a project is good or bad. Like if a reading was about a mall and how it effects the choice a student has on how to spend time, there are many directions a project could go from there. Students as a whole could easily waste time on a project by procrastinating, but usually it is because they are not sure on what to do. There will always be a student who does not finish in time or even starts it, but those who try and do work efficiently tend to do better time wise. Instead of wasting a student and a teachers time, it is better to have a foundation of a project given by a teacher than having everything be up to and decided by the student. ",3,0,144

D5FDDB4DFA82,"Conclusion.As a student who has had to deal with a multitude of summer projects, I can say without a doubt that I have never looked forward to spending time out of my day to work on them. The most typical summer project given to me and most students has been summer reading. The books are almost always teacher assigned, subsequently tying them into their curriculum for the upcoming year. Before my junior year began, I was tasked with reading

In Cold Blood by Truman Capote for my English class. Personally, I enjoyed the book, but the project that went along with it was less than interesting. In turn, this led to me putting off my project until the last few days of my summer break, bringing along the stress of having to cram it in before the school year started. Since this project was teacher-designed, I also had to make sure to follow the strict guidelines in order to ensure a high grade when I turned it in to the teacher. ",3,2,172
D5FDDB4DFA82,"Conclusion.If I was able to create my own project relating to the book rather than a teacher-designed project, I truly believe I would have enjoyed my finished product more than I did, along with eliminating the stress put upon me by the project's strict guidelines. ",0,2,46
D5FDDB4DFA82,"Conclusion.When a student is assigned a summer project, their immediate thoughts are almost always negative. This comes with the fact that they do not want to do work over their break, as this is one of the few times out of the year that they're allowed to forget about school for just one moment. Adding to this, if the student is given a teacher-designed project, this puts the motivation to do said project even lower than before. They know that they have no control over how their project turns out, as they often revolve around a fairly black-and-white rubric, resulting in a lack of diversity and creativity between each individual's project. ",3,2,112
D5FDDB4DFA82,"Conclusion.If a student is tasked with the creation of their own project, however, this leads to a wide variety of exciting and new projects that vary from student to student, also placing motivation in their hearts to make the best project they possibly can. ",0,2,45
D60320508249,Conclusion.Many students have quite the chaotic schedule during the summer months. ,3,2,12
D60320508249,"Conclusion.For example, if a student is going to Latin America over the summer, instead of having them mindlessly conjugate verbs on worksheets to submit for their Spanish class, they can actually put what they learned to use out in the world by talking with locals or taking in the culture through music and food. If another student doesn't happen to have a passport and a couple thousand dollars lying around, they can adjust it to their situation, for example going to a local Latin grocery store and buying ingreedients in Spanish in order to make a native dish. ",3,2,99
D60320508249,"Conclusion.These examples highlight another main benefit of letting students design their own summer projects, that being the increased opportunities that are availible outside of the classroom. ",0,2,27
D60320508249,"Conclusion.Instead of having one general project assigned by the teacher that is monotonus and isn't any different than regular school, students can customize their learning to their specific situation and access things that aren't availible inside the classroom. Students that are interested in making music can apply for internships at music studios that have nicer equipment than their school. Students that enjoy writing can work with local journalists and get a feel for what writing is like for a bigger publication than just their school paper. ",3,2,87
D60320508249,"Conclusion.One might be thinking at this point, ""Come on now. This is great for all the kids who are motivated to learn and are enough of a go-getter to go out and do this stuff, but what about the ones who just want to sit inside and play video games or hang out with their friends?""

D69416DBA6F4,"Conclusion.Hundreds of students would attempt to get into a variety of clubs. If a specific club, though, is very popular, then with all the students trying to get in, the space would be limited. The students who are rejected from the group might not have another club that they are willing to join, but they will have to find one. This can lead to sadness, anger, jealousy to other people who got in, and other bad feelings. Bad cases of these feelings can lead to stress, fights, and even broken friendships. ",3,0,92

D69416DBA6F4,"Conclusion.but the students should have freedom over what they do. At least, if anything, contact the students' parents and ask them for approval. Don't just force them to, though, because it's not right to force students to participate in any activities that they aren't interested in doing. With this, I believe that the students should have the freedom to choose and not have to participate in any activity if they aren't intrigued. ",6,2,73
D69416DBA6F4,"Concluding Statement.I strongly disagree with the idea of making all students participate in extracurricular activities. If the students want to participate, then they can. If they don't want to participate or join, then they shouldn't have to. With how crowded it would be, the loss of homework time it would bring, and stress causing it would create, I don't believe that students should be forced into that. I believe the students should be given the choice, and if some of them don't accept, try to convince others. Instead of making them all participate, ask them what activities they like and improve the clubs or create new clubs based on their opinions ",1,2,112

I also met some of my best friends that I still talk to today, they were super inviting and had a passion for the game and enjoyed it. I had never seen anyone enjoy a game that much. When thinking about it, it seems like a very funny and interesting story how you met your friends but when I talk to some kids they tell me that they met their best friends of today by simply sharing the same interests and that is a great way to make friends. When going to a certain activity you go because you enjoy that one thing, well the other people there also enjoy that activity and now you know a whole bunch of people who share a common interest with you. sometimes even the smallest things can spark a friendship maybe you and someone play the same position on a sports team that can be a great reason to be friends or to even talk, doing extra curricular activities gets you out of your comfort zone and makes you feel just open and wanting to talk to people. When going to a certain activity thinking of how the people there are gonna act is a huge thing but most likely the environment is very welcoming and it makes you want to keep doing that one thing with the same people because of how they treated you.

In Europe passenger cars are reponsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States.

To help reduce the gas emmisions caused by automobiles many countries around the world have created programs and communities that are designed to lessen the amount of car usage in the areas that they are employed in ",4,0,87
DA8115F12B50,"Conclusion.When people start to use cars less and less then businesses would most likely move to more accessable locations which in turn may give the businesses more customers. Due to the increased business in certain stores, stores from different companies will likely move in to areas in and around the one the other businesses reside in to drum up their sales as well. The article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" supports my statement in the with the sentence, ""Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" The sentence shows the correlation between lessening car usage and municipal development. ",3,0,132

DABEF78A3A24,"Conclusion.Conducting research requires numerous forms of evidence, samples, test, etc. In paragraph 5, the author makes suggestions of creating a spacecraft to sustain temperatures of at least 170 degrees Fahrenheit and levitating thirty-plus miles over the surface to observe the planet. Although this may be the most safest and efficient approach, he even stated that it would require getting ""up close and personal"" to collect samples. The whole idea is to reach Venus and collect data to compare to Earth and Venus' previous history. ",3,2,85

DCABFA6AD5AE,"Conclusion.Summers can be the best times of a students life. They get a break from the stress and anxiety of school and they are allowed to do any and all things they wish to do within the legal limits. Summer projects are designed to keep students engaged and learning. This can be a very good thing as long as the project is based on a topic that the student actually enjoys and will be motivated to complete. Students struggle staying engaged enough during the school year, adding a project during the time they are meant to go be kids should be handled very carefully. ",4,2,105
DCABFA6AD5AE,"Conclusion.This will give the students structure and something to base their project on instead of having all the options in the world and not being able to choose one. In school, students are normally more prepared if it is a topic they have been learning about and have background knowledge on compared to a project half way through a topic, or even towards the beginning. If students are given a short book or even a PowerPoint on the topic at hand they will be more successful in completing their project. ",3,2,91
DCDE7152B94E,Conclusion.Some people are different from others not everyone will want to go the same way meaning . They rather have their own privacy and not be on a bus or a train full of random people that might be sick with a flu or smell really nasty. Thats why 80 percent of transportation has been thruogh highways an only 20 percent to other transportation . Most of the people who intend to use train or buses don't have the right amount of money to purchase a brand new car or even a used one . The cause of that is Taxes or IRS are taking to much from the people who work to hard an theres nothing that can be done too that. ,3,0,121
DCDE7152B94E,"Conclusion.The way Bogota is going is the best idea that I've ever heard of they couldn't of nailed it any better . They stopped a capital city of 7 millon people from using their cars . An look at the good effects it did, new restaurants where opened an upscale shopping district haved cropped up .  The pitted an uneven sidewalks have been fixed an replaced by new smooth sidwalks. Even parks and sports centers haved also bloomed throughout the city, which is good because parents have more time an money to get their kids more actived in to sports an going out to play. ",2,0,103
DCDE7152B94E,Conclusion.The last passage explanes what I've been saying less people are buying cars why invent new things . People are going unemployedment an things aren't going to get any better for our country . The governments are asking for to much plus you have taxes an the IRS right behind them waiting to grab your money that you worked hard for . Another thing that I don't get is why the President of the untied states can help other countries but yet can't even of seem to help his own country who is lossing more money as days go by . Whats going on up their in the white house we the people slecet you the president to run our country not others an help benfit us. ,3,1,124
DD3F7252F887,Concluding Statement.We have expressions every day but sometimes can be hard to tell how we are feeling. Most people dont know how other people feel but this can let other people understand what they are going through. This can also let people track the emotion they want to know if that person is feeling. Yes i do think that this system should be used. It can help alot. This would be very useful in alot of things. ,1,0,78

DF76BBCD85B1,"Conclusion.Most students can't wait for the last day of school so they don't have to do any work or should I say ""learn"".

Also if they do a summer project it should help preview what they are going to be learning in the upcoming school year, so if they don't know exactly what it is that they will be learning why should they have to design their own project which most would not what to do in the first place.

In addition to the students designing their own project there are a lot of potential problems that could occur.

Like they forget to inform everyone else on what the project is.

The students just are not mature or responsible enough to be able to design such a hefty task like a summer project all on their own. ",3,0,138

DF7D4CA4A89E,Conclusion.Technology can make people mad in happy its just how you use it in how you do it like you can look up things that you know that will make you happy. But in this story its saying that the computers know when you happy or sad or even confused but then it can help the person because it say it can modify. Its a lot that the technology it can't look you in the face in see that something is wrong with you. The story is saying they want to know how people are feeling even when they are trying to hide it i think that is personal and the person will tell you if the person wanted you to know. ,3,1,123
DF890FC7D48F,Conclusion.If the students know and respect their teacher than they wont act up during class time and the class will be able to get more stuff done.

E05ACF2DFCB8,Concluding Statement.The design of what project the students are given in the summer should completly be their own design not the teachers. If the students design their own projects they will mostlikley do something they like . If they do something that they like they will get it done and the learning experiance will be so much better then if the teacher designed what the students where told to do over the summer . It being said if the students where able to design the project they would enjoy it and be able to get all supplies they need for it because the teacher might pick something the student might not like or something they cant get supplies for. They would also probaly love to be told they have a project to do over the summer if it was their design and get it done. So overall students should be allowed to design their own projects so they can learn more in the summer.  ,1,2,163

Paris bans driving due to smog

""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals..."" In addition, Duffer continues to provide evidence to this claim by further emphasizing and comparing ""[Last] week Paris had 147 miocrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London,"" By including this simple sentence, we are fully aware of just how much harm pollution has done to the environment due to car uage in Paris. Moreover, the smog in Paris was so intense that ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""

E22134365CE5,"Conclusion.because, it says "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becomine confused or bores"" in the text. While looking in a mirror, you see your own reflection of yourself because, it says ""Raise your lips at the corners of your mouth bacause, technology can't do that.

E3349F640D64,"Conclusion.All computers would have to have facial recognition in their system and although there is no mention of cost in the article one can imagine that this new technology is not cheap. Is it realistic to expect that schools will pay great amounts of tax payers dollars just so that we can invade the privacy of our children to figure out if they are bored? It seems much more financially sound to not steal the jobs of millions of teachers and let them get to know their students, opposed to scanning their face. ",3,2,94

E36560297AD9,"Conclusion.Sure it can be difficult but, there are many reasons why teacher-designed summer projects would work better. ",5,2,18
E36560297AD9,"Conclusion.If a student is engaged, they are more likely to succeed. Teachers engage students by designing summer projects in a way that interests them. A student who is engaged in their project is more likely to receive a good grade than a student who showed no interest in it at all. Teachers typically try to stick to things that inspire all students equally, they try not to lean towards a specific influence as to remain unbiased. Students have many different interests which is why student-organized projects would be beneficial. A teacher with a good understanding of their student's likes and dislikes can better organize a project that will help students be engaged. Keeping students engaged is a difficult, but manageable, task and while not every teacher can do it, they all try. ",3,2,133
E37D480CD473,"Conclusion.If student-designed projects are too easy, they end up simply becoming busy work. More difficult teacher-designed projects would challenge students, which may seem unappealing to many, however in order to grow academically, students need a stimulus to respond to. Moreover, students become stronger learners when they are forced to overcome challenges. These challenges could include: reading a book in a foreign language; reading a book that is longer than they would like and far more dense than they are used to; or having to perform operations with dificult mathematic equations, formulas, and concepts. Nevertheless these challenges will make students think heavily and help them become better educated. ",3,2,108

With the FACS that topic at dinner can be changed because the FACS can modify lessons if the students are bored or confused so that students develop more information in a days work at school. The able to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is also valuble because if a student is struggling with mental problems, rather than being bored or confused, the FACS can detect what he or she is feeling and that particular student can get the help he or she needs to succeed in life. As one can see, the FACS would be an incredible improvement in all classrooms across American and over seas because with the effects of the FACS students will be able to learn and take away more from a lesson than before.

In conclusion there has been plenty of research and examinations on the Face of Mars. I still think that the Face is real, others might think differently. This topic can go both ways in opinon wise. Think wise about this topic. Consider talking about it with coleagues and come up with a conclusion for this topic. ",1,1,110
E627C066A0F1,Conclusion.I think its true because some computers now have facial scan recognition but they cost a arm and a leg to buy but i dont think its worth it to buy a computer that cost a arm and a leg because if something goes wrong with the computer their will be no refunds but their should be refunds because they could probably sell u a broken or damaged computer. ,5,1,70
E627C066A0F1,"Conclusion.Next: do think it would be a good idea to make a computer thats u can only access with your face because now a days people tend to steal stuff that doesnt belong to them like for example i had a friend who tried to steal my headphones one day but i had officer force her to give them back but when she gave them back the were broke.

Conclusion: i think that mona lisa probably was a hard picture to face scan because there were so many differnt copys of the original paintning but im pretty sure the real painting is in a museum heavinly gauarded by people with heavy artilllery and grenades and army men with truck but inconclusion if your a great painter do your best because one day u might a famouse painter like Leanardo da Vinci or bettter   ",3,1,144
E686584E5508,"Conclusion.As Dr. Huang says in paragraph 4 ""the facial expression for each emotions are universal,"" ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" and that you can also reproduce a smile is weird ( I never knew that was a thing).But yea FACs can show you what your mood(s) are in a picture just by scanning your facial parts. Muscles called orbiculariaris make crows feet around your eye, but in a false smile. the mouth is strectched sideways using zygomatic major and a different muscle, the riorius. So all the muscles can get the coding to scan your face and it'll tell you the percentage of the mood that you are in whether you're sad, mad, happy, bored, it will tell you all of that jazyy stuff.

They wouldnt what anything with us if they did I think they would have made more signs then just two dots and a straight line and they would have made the face more noticable and it dissapears after a couple of years that is probbaly of there is wind or something that might have blew away they face ,3,1,79
E7A3DBC919C1,"Conclusion.I don't think that humans should use it on other humans unless they had permission to do so. When people hear about this device they may think that it isn't worth it, but it could be useful when it comes to things that happened long ago. Seeing other peoples emotions can be harmful to them unless they allowed you to do so. A lot of people want to hide their emotions and keep them to themselves. Emotions are something that can be shared or they can be kept away inside somebody. They can tell people or they can hide it, either way its up to them.

E9363204BCEF,"Conclusion.Instead of lazing over homework or moping around their house, children can be brighter and happier to get things done. When students are in an environment they enjoy, it can motivate them and brighten up their day. No one likes sitting in a classroom for seven hours. If students have something exciting to look forward to at the end of the day or the day after, it will push them to get their work done to participate in what they want to do. ",3,2,84
E9363204BCEF,"Conclusion.Having something in common helps people socialize and discuss that topic. Then, children can make friends over things they both like to do and discuss, plus they'll be able to work together on the topic.

They talk about some features that earth has like venus has valleys in mountains in craters in paragraph 4 it talks about some of the same features it has with earth. They are looking for more ways they can reserch they are thinking about sending some rovers to look around take pictures of the place in how they can actually go around in check out the planet but the way they been doing is taking pictures from a ship in actually actually looking from close thats what they been doing they still dont want to send people there cuase they dont want to take cuations of someone dying in the planet. ,3,1,166

Erratic driving patterns can be extremely dangerous to everyone else on the road, including other drivers, pedestrians, and animals. Also, motorist involved in a stressful or emotional phone conversation may exhibit aggressive behavior while they drive, such as road rage. This may cause the erratic driving to worsen and this greatly increases the chance of causing an accident.

EB793B72A8C4,"Conclusion.Some of my friends go home and do nothing after school. It can get boring to have nothing to do for the remainder of the day. Participating in an after-school activity can pass time and help you to not be bored, especially if you are participating in an activity you enjoy. When I was in elementary school, I went to an after-school art club so I could pass the time doing something that I liked. I also did after-school soccer in the fourth grade, and I started playing volleyball in the fourth grade. I am still playing volleyball to this day. These kinds of activities can give you something to do instead of going on your phone and doing nothing. I have gotten more productive over the past couple of years because I participate in extracurricular activities. I believe that kids can be more productive, and extracurricular activities are a vital way to achieve this goal. Not only is it a good way to spend your time, but it is also a good way to meet people. 
",3,2,178
EB793B72A8C4,"Conclusion.For example, I once convinced my sister to play volleyball. She didn't really want to do it. After school that day, she came to our volleyball practice. She ended up loving the sport, and she also plays it to this day. There are many different activities, such as theater, art, sports, science and math clubs, and the student council. Students are most likely going to find an activity they like and stick with it as they get older. Doing an activity that you enjoy can be very entertaining, and you might keep doing it in the future. I am in my school's eighth grade chorus, and I want to continue this activity as I get into high school. If you really enjoy these activities at school, you might also try to practice them at home. If you like to go to an art club at your school, you might continue to draw at home. These activities can also lead to trying to improve in your hobby as well. I continue to draw at home so I can improve. Schools give access to these potential new hobbies and activities, and I think that students should go to them and give them a chance. ",3,2,203
EB793B72A8C4,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion, I believe that students should be required to take at least one extracurricular activity. It is something that I believe is crucial to who students grow up to be. If students join an after-school activity, they can become more responsible. Having them sit around all day can make that person lazy in the future. They not might want to try new things in the future because they were raised that way. Giving kids these potential interests can help impact their choices in life, such as what they want to do for a job or what they want to do for a hobby. People might already have their future planned, but joining an extracurricular activity can change their views and can give them new ideas. Overall, I think that extracurricular activities are a good way for students and kids to spend their time participating in and enjoying.  ",1,0,150
EB7944FDAF63,"Conclusion.For example, if a student watches a video lesson in a History class and is confused by something then their teacher could find the question, or peice of video, and simply adjust the lesson to fit the demographic and understanding of that child. There are many benifits to this technology including in the home, if a parent were to have the ability to see where their child was confused or frusterated the parent could also take some time to cover the missing material.

ECD640058D57,"Conclusion.My brother Generic_Name, when it was his last year of high school, his teacher made him do a project on what they have learned and remembered most out of their 4 years of high school. The thing he remembers most was his mechanical teacher having faith in him and telling him he could do it when no one believed in him. In his project, he made a poster based on his teacher and something he said "" You believe in yourself, you can accomplish anything what the world gives you."" During those 4 years, he struggled with school. He though he couldn't do it and he didn't even know what he was going to do after high school. But when he joined this mechanics class, he fell in loved with everything. All his time was invested into mechanics. His teacher saw potential in him when he first walked into class. Then one day, his teacher called him up and asked what he wants to do after high school, He had no answer because he didnt know what to do. So his gave him a opportunity to get an interview with this company he know and worked their before. And at first he was speechless, because no one in that school believed in him and thinks that he wouldn't do nothing with his life. So in the poster, he wrote a passage on why he fell in love with that class and he added pictures of him and his teacher working together ",3,0,253
ECD640058D57,"Conclusion.My Best Friend Generic_Name, had a teacher that liked her personality and the way she made people feel loved and included when no one wanted to. At the end of middle school, her teacher asked everyone to do a project. So for her project, she did it on one person which it was about her teacher. Her Spanish teacher, was strict on students but never lost faith in each student she had. But something about her made my friend and her have a connection. My friend has a mom that supports her in everything, but her Spanish teacher never had a kid. So my friend Generic_Name was like a daughter to her. She felt like she had a bond like her mom. Then one day for parent's night, Generic_Name's mom went to her Spanish class, and her teacher and her mom clicked away. They've became best friends out of no where. She was surprised because she didnt know if they would like each other or something she thought wouldn't work out. They've been friend's for 8 years already, and have so much in common. Her teacher was a person she can go for anything and without one question be afraid to tell her anything. So for her project, she did a poster of her mom and Spanish teacher. The connection they have, no one in the world could have that. Her Spanish teacher was important to her because she felt alone sometimes and had no one to talk to and she felt like she can go to her and talk about her problems with her. They have a bond she won't forget ever. She added pictures and saying thank you for everything for and nothing less. And for helping her in her rough days and making them somewhat better ",3,0,300
ECD640058D57,"Concluding Statement.Although some might think, my friend Generic_Name, my brother Generic_Name, and my best friend Generic_Name. If they each didn't have a teacher who had faith in them who knows what they would be doing right now. They each had someone that cared and loved them when one wanna to. I think having that special someone can do wonders in life and help out a lot. So teachers should let their students do their own project without no instructions and let them rethink what they they have learned and make it into a project where they could lay out their ideas and make it into something wonderful.     ",1,0,108

EE0229233F51,"Conclusion.Well, first of all, The atmospere of Venus has a THICK layer of carbon dioxide the covers 98% of the planet, in which makes Everything a much hoter place,but, to top it of with the atmosphere problem, the clouds in there have highly corrosive sulfuric acid. If we some how passes through the atmosphere, than we'll face ANOTHER problem with the ground. Since Venus is the second planet from our sun and with all those carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the surface ground temperature is over 800 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. In which with the surface and the atmosphere, it could basically melt many types of metal with no problem. Another Problem is that the atmosphereic preassure is 90x greater than our Earth, with that much preassure could easily crushed a submarine that is built to surrvive the deeper end of the ocean. From what we gather small information from our space craft, the geology of venus pretty much have erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes. ",3,2,168
EE0229233F51,"Concluding Statement.To me, I'd thought that it wouldn't be worth all the trouble to study more of this when we can study other planets like mars that support life better than Venus since it's surface and atmosphere wasn't as crazy as Venus'. ",1,1,43
EE377D38C330,"Conclusion.A lot of people don't know that this techonolgy nowadays could determine the way you feel, it could determine the emotions that peope feel. It also shows the emotions or feelings of others. People probably think that this some type of joke or laugher kind of way when its not there really is techonology nowadays that could detect it. There's probably many ways people can detect to read the emotional expressions of students. Some ways that you probably didn't even know of. ",4,0,83
EE377D38C330,Conclusion.but if they think about it instead of waisting your time just guessing what their emotions are you would know if they use the proper techonology. They had made a process that began when the computer constructed a 3-D computer model of the face and it showed that all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. ,6,1,61
EE377D38C330,"Conclusion.Another interesting thing that they discovered was that Dr. Paul Eckman was the creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). He had classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. It also associated each with characterestic movements of the facial muscles. They invented somethIng else called video imagery, the new emotion software is that they track facial movement ",3,0,62

EEC9540E73FD,Conclusion.Some schools have debated if they should make every single student participate in extracurricular activities. I believe that they should not make kids do extracurricular activities they don't want to do. It would be extra work for the school and it would be bad for the students. If the principal decided to change the school's system so that each and every student would have to do an extracurricular activity it would end up negatively for most students. The main reasons it would be bad are ,4,2,86
EEC9540E73FD,"Conclusion.In fact, according to a study performed by Harvard University, almost 85 percent of students participate in after school activities that take up more than 8 hours of time per week. This would include practicing the activity and for many activities you would have to compete. For example, one of my friends, Generic_Name, does many activities. She plays on a competitive lacrosse team, she plays a musical instrument, and she takes all honor classes. She barely finishes all of her homework, and she has stupendous time management skills. If she had to take part in another after school activity, she wouldn't have time to do it all. Because kids do other things, if you made them partake in a new activity they would also become a lot more stressed. ",3,2,130
EEC9540E73FD,"Conclusion.The main extracurricular activities that people partake at my school are plays and clubs where you can compete in, such as Model United Nations, debate club, Science Olympiad, and many others. At my school with over 1,000 students, only about 100 decide to join these clubs. These clubs only appeal to certain people that enjoy academics. If you're interested in things related to sports, my school does not have much to offer for you. When my sister was in middle school, about 7 years ago, they had very few clubs. They had 3 official clubs. Our mom made her choose a club to participate in. All that she could choose from was debate club, chess club, and homework club.

She had little to no interest in doing any of these clubs that she thought were boring and dumb. She ended up doing chess club, but she ended up hating it immensely. She said that everyone was better than her and she didn't even know how to play. This all happened because she was forced to pick an activity from three, horrible sounding, activities. This all would not have happened if no one had made her do an activity she despised. The same thing will end up happening to many children if the schools make them participate in activities they don't wish to do. Kids doing something that they don't want to do will end up with them being unhappy, which will end up in a negative learning environment. ",3,2,250
EEC9540E73FD,"Concluding Statement.Many kids will suffer majorly if a school was to go through with this ridiculous plan of forcing people to do an extracurricular activity that they do not wish to take part in. In the end, this will benefit basically nobody, because if someone really needed or wanted to participate in extra activities, they could without having to affect every person other than themselves in the school. Many would be upset with this new plan, so I believe that it would be best to keep our system the same. ",1,0,91

F038426B8B5A,Conclusion.Some Schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Projects are used to enhance learning in a different way. During the summer no student wants to work on school work or even think about school. ,4,0,43
F038426B8B5A,Conclusion.Students already dont want to do the project in the first place so the idea may be very confusing to other students or the teacher. If the project is a group project the idea may not be understood fully and may get taking the wrong way. Students school brains are already shut down so when to making ideas students tend to wing it and just throw it out especially when it is a group project. They think that the other is just going to figure it out on their own and that may not be the case or they leave each other hanging. Teacher- based projects make it easier because the idea and instructions are already there and all the students have to do is just follow them. ,3,2,129

F245631F4D97,"Conclusion.The Generic_School system as had tremendous amount of trouble in which teachers have to ask for multiple planning days. The reasoning for this is due to the fact that students don't knowing the fundamental requirements for a class when they walk into the classroom on the first day. This causes teachers to have to readjust their curriculum in order for the students to catch up to where the teacher wants them to be.

F36E4C217F66,"Conclusion.Venus is an second planet for the sun. Sometime Venus is called the ""Evening

Star,"" because Venus is one of the brightest points on light in the night sky. Venus also have a nickname like other planets have different nicknames. Venus nickname is misleading.

-

Earth, Venus, and Mars are our other planetary neighbor, they orbit in a different speeds. there is a time when Mars is getting closer to our planet Earth and there is a time when Venus is getting closer to the Earth.

Often Venus referred to as Earth's twin because Venus is the closest planet to

Earth in a size and occasionlly the closest in distance.

Like other planets have atmosphere and different temperture, Venus also have atmospere and differents temperture. When a spaceship when to Venus it couldn't survived the landing for more than a few hours because unlike Venus's surface is hottest in our solar system even though Mercury is closer to our sun.

A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus.

Venus's clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in it atmosphere. ",3,1,184

F647D77D7396,"Conclusion.Students learn up to four units a year and are assigned up to two projects per unit. Within the year, students attend around 240 classes per-year in taking around 1,920 hours of learning. Within all of the lessons and assignments, one is able to remember an abundant amount of information per-unit, allowing a student to combine all work into a project. Assume a project was based on biodiversity of animals within the agricultural system. With knowledge from ones own memory combined with notes and previous assignments, a project that consists of a 500-word summery of biodiversity will seem like a quick explanation. Though many children around the world suffer from short-term memory loss or just have difficulty harnessing previous knowledge, additional help from previous worksheets to study from or a phone call to a friend that has the same assignment might be able to significantly give a boost of memory or a kick-start. If all is lost from the previous year and making a phone call is not an option, libraries and the vast online knowledge of the web can help support uneasy topics and questions. ",3,2,188
F647D77D7396,"Conclusion.Most occupations don't give out ""summer breaks"" for adults because a company can't run without their employees constantly focused on doing their work.

Most college students don't get their parents to pay for their all of their supplies anymore. Reciving summer work is just a small step to the upcoming constant work of employees. To make sure students are ready to become an intern or employee, their teachers responsibilities are to make sure students are able to implement previous knowledge into future tasks. ",3,2,104

F880CDD90C95,"Conclusion.There was a study at Oxford University a few years ago, back in 2016. They examined the affect of fifty college students attitudes and mood throughout one month, with twenty-five of them doing an activity unrelated to school, and the other twenty-five who didn't participate in an extracurricular activity. After a month of research and testing, the professors at the univerisity got their results. It was proven that the students that did do something unrelated to schoolwork, were much happier, had higher levels of dopamine, good grades, and were able to fuction through their daily lives with barely any obstacles or problems. However, the students that didn't participate in anything had lower levels of dopamine and were a lot more stressed out. Then, because of this, their grades were affected drastically. Doing an activity like track or joining a club would be better for a students mental health. ",3,2,149

F8C22ACD1774,"Conclusion.The process of completing a project goes smoother when given rules to follow and, within those rules, allowing students to express themselves even more than that of a guideline-free project. ",0,2,31
F8C22ACD1774,"Conclusion.Many students would jump at the opportunity to get ahead on the information for the next school year and many may not enjoy the requirement, but appreciate the opportunity.

Giving clear instructions provides the structure to learn and get ahead before the race for grades begins.

A summer project in which the students are designing and planning does not insure they will continue to learn during their break, but instead assures teachers that students will attempt to make it as non complex and superficial for themselves as possible.

Providing students with the opportunity to design their project uniquely with no specifications needed enables them to be lazy in the creation of the project and miss critical information for the subject that the project is on.

Students come up with many ways to avoid in depth descriptions of a topic because of the lack of motivation to do so.

With clear instructions, students will be able to find the information the teacher wants and needs in order to grade the project, and the information needed to elaborate on this knowledge in the beginning of the school year.

Students want the ability to enjoy the summer and with the specific necessities for the summer project highlighted, they will not have the stress of creating a project from scratch. ",3,2,217
F8C22ACD1774,"Conclusion.Many people have found student-designed projects to be more time consuming, although less tedious, and will overall take away from the main purpose of summer vacation which is to recover from the stress induced during the school year. ",0,2,39
F8C22ACD1774,"Concluding Statement.summer is a time for rejuvenation and recuperation; therefore, requiring an abstract project during this time is inadequate to the idea that many students are unable to complete such a task based on prior engagements, no structural support to aid in finding information needed, and upholding the sole purpose of summer.

Students do not want the stress of the school year carried over into the summer and neither do teachers, for students may find the need to contact teachers about what they can and cannot do if there is not a rubric they are able to follow. ",1,2,99

F9238D9E5631,"Concluding Statement.Although some may state that it is better for teachers to design summer projects, it is actually better for these projects to be student-designed. This is the case due to students being more creative, effective, and independent in their own work as they control the factors that make up their project. Those who believe it is better for teachers to design summer projects may state that set guidelines ensure the project is done efficiently and makes sure that it is done right, but this is not true. This is an ongoing debate due to these projects being one of the major sources of academic stimulation for many students during the summer, which leads back to the idea that students should design their own summer projects as it would add many individual benefits during this time period.

F955CE7D650C,"Conclusion.Students know how much work they are able to do as well as the skill level required for their project. When students create their own projects its always going to be able something they enjoy, making it easier for them to do the project and be held accountable for it. Students are also able to create their own project knowing they are being graded not on the standard for everyone else but the standard for themselves. This takes a lot of pressure off of students as they feel like they will be graded fairly as long as long as they do as much as they are capable of doing and do it well. If the student does not complete the project for whatever reason it is much easier for them to be held accountable for it, as excuses like ""I didnt understand"" or ""It was to hard for me"" will become invalid because they are the ones who create the project. Thus making it clear that student designed projects will benefit everyone and insure work is being down. ",3,2,179

FACC34F1875E,"Conclusion.Five cities have been reported to have had a day to where they banned cars. They call these days, ""Car Free Days"". Vauban, Germany; Paris, France; Bogota, Colombia; Cali Colombia; and Valledupar Colombia. This day ended with positive results.

FACC34F1875E,"Conclusion.For starters, the residents in Vaulban, Germany have given up their cars. Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbudden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg. Vauban's streets are completely ""car free""--except the main thoroughfare. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park--large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for forty thousand dollars, along with a home. As a result, seventy percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and fifty seven percent sold their cars just to move here. In the passage, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two, she quotes,"" When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.""

Additionally, Cars are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai ten to make  their homes. Experts say that that is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emmissions from tailpipes. Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to fifty percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

Futhermore, after days of near-record pollution, Paris, France enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, states that congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of France, after just five days of intensifying smog. ",3,1,250
FACF20D0D847,"Conclusion.I became a Seagoing Cowboy when me frend invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat. It was when World War II was going on. Some countries were left to die and had nothing. So they formed the UNRRA and hired ''Seagoing Cowboys.'' Both I and Don Signed up.

In August of 1945, they recived orders to go and report to New Orleans.''We arived August 14,'' Luke recalled ''the day the Pasific War ended.'' They got their seaman's papers and and borded the SS Charles. W. Wooster. They then headed for Greace.

Before I got to Greace he turned 18 wich ment the military could draft me .''When my draft board learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip,they tolde me to just keep doing that for my service,'' Luke says.

''The cattle boat trips were an unbeliavable opportunity for a small-town boy,'' Besides helping people, I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China.'' but seeing the Acropolis in Greace was very speacial. So was takeing a gondola ride in Vince, Italy a city with streets of water.''

It was also hard work. I had to clean, feed, and care for the anamals. I seved as a night wathman, meaning I had to cheak on all the anamals and report to the captin every hour. One ranny night after my hourly report I slipped on a ladder and fell on my backside. I was fine but couldn't work for a couple of days because of broken ribs. I also had fun too and played vollyball games in empty holdes and more.

FAF91DDF582C,"Concluding Statement.Schools that require students to continue learning during the summer will see positive results in students academic lives. Designated work from teachers will greatly help alumni master and perfect classroom skills. Not to mention, students will acquire more knowledge on these areas with the extra help that was provided. If the teacher knows what their students need to work more on, those students will soon be ready to take on anything once school is in cession again. If students were given the liberty to pick their projects, would the students actually learn from it? What happens if the student chooses an easy project, when they could have been working on some other topic that they know they have trouble with? This will certainly not be a good idea. As professionals, teachers know what is best for their students if they have been observing their classroom performance. However, Many teachers sometimes overlook a few things in which student have trouble with. When this happens the student should take a step forward and let their teacher know what it is they think they need to work. This way the teacher can look back and verify is this person does need to practice more in the areas that they may be struggling. ",1,2,211

FD0C32EA0E5B,"Conclusion.The main characters were Luke and his friend. Basically the story is about his friend giving him a once in a life time opportunity. He first worked at a grocery store and and the bank. When his friend invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. He couldnt say no. So then he went.

He had graduated from high school and had 2 jobs but whem his friend invited him to Europe his whole llife had changed. Since there was a war he went to go help out. He and Don had signed up to be a segoing cowboy. 44 nations joined toggether and formed a UNNRA and he was hired to be a seagoing cowboy. That when you have to take care of horses , mules adnd young cows. That was his job over there in Europe.

He kept going there and he kept helping others. He like his job. The cattle boats were unbelievable for a small town boy it had said. He really enjoyed his job. He toured lots of places like Venice Italy and a city with streets of water. But Luke had made 9 trpis the most of any seagoing cowboy. He traveled across the atlantic ocean and it took him about 2 weeks.

He was taking care of lots of animals and was feeding them 2 or 3 times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats. They had to be pulled. He had helped out his aunt Katie as a boy. So he was prepared for this. On his second trip he was served as a night watchman. His job was to check the animals every hour. Then one rainy night he had slipped down on a slippery ladder. His heart raced. But luckly he lived. ",3,1,296

May that is the issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on venus in more than three deacades) say the auther in the artivcle. ",3,1,70
FD1C07651D9A,"Conclusion.The auther also say in the artivcle (that the atmospher of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. Even more challenging are in the clouds of the highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venis atmosphere. He said the on the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degerees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than what we experience on our own planet.) Also the conditions are far more extree than anything humans encounter on the earth; such as environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deppest parts of our ocean and would liquefy many metals. Also notable, venus has the hottest surface temperature of any plantes in our solar system even though mercury is closer to ur sun. ",3,1,125
FD1C07651D9A,"Conclusion.Beyond high pressure and heat, venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like eruping volcanoes powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

FF7AFA7FF8B6,"Conclusion.I wanted to inform you that there is a limit for driving a car there has been some changes during this few years. Its not only in America that is going on its in other cities and also in states, where people have been droping there adavantages to drive around and dicide to walk instead or to ride a bus to get to other places, they also do that to save money for the gasoline especially if they drive long distance. For example in German Suburb they have forbidden street parking, driveways and home garages, new district on outskirts of freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. There's a place called Vauban's and its a total Car-free, 70% of vaubans don't own a car and 57% sold thier car to move here. In Paris, they have banded driving due to smog, can ya'll believe that?;they have done because after days of near pollution paris inforced partial driving to clean the air of global city. people that drived with a even-numbered license plate they were charged a 31 dollars fine almost 4,000 drivers were fine according to Reuters. Now the ""smog"" came from Beijing,China which is one of the most polluted city in the world.

Paris typically has more smog then other European capitals, but eventually the smog cleared enough for The Ruling French party. There's was also a Car-Free day in Bogata and it was a big hit, Colombians usually hiked,biked,skated or even took buses to work during the car-free day if you left early people avoid traffic jams. and there goal is to promte alternative transportation and reduce smog it was a good ways to take way stress and lower air pollution. there's parks and sports centers that have bloomed throughout the city; uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad,rush-hours have dramatically cut traffic. The End of Car Culture, where president Obama ambitious goal to curb the United States greenhouse gas emission,unveiled last week. Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less, but also getting fewer licenses as years go by. theres a question that says 'Has America passed peak driving?""i mean am not sure how to explan ,but am sure america ids the the same as it use to be and now that they are talking or writing a articule about it means that alot of people are driving less and buying cars.

01B3A57AB13D,"Conclusion.Firstly, the primary reasons why schools get canceled and have to plan extra days within the school year is because of the fear of dangerous weather conditions that threatens the safety of the student body. ",0,2,36
01B3A57AB13D,Conclusion.Private and public schools are forcing their students into a regime and strict schedule that takes up the majority of the mornings and afternoons of their students' life which disables them the ability to apply for internships or well paying part time jobs that occur during typical school hours. Online classes would allow students the ability to choose the time for their classes which forces students to practice prioritizing responsibilities and improve on their time management skill. An example of students who mostly work while attending school are college students who have to pay for their attendance and possibly even lodging within the college campus. Virtual classrooms would allow these students to build their work portfolio while also allowing students to return home after work and finish their academic assignments at home during nighttime. Another reason as to why online courses' flexible schedule is beneficial for students is because they would be able to have enough time during daylight hours to volunteer and help give back to their community which builds the morals and social connections with others in the community while also allowing the students to formally engage in academic studies at home after they've finished volunteering. Students would greatly benefit from online classes where a flexible schedule will allow students to have more time to engage in different experiences in life and formulate a more balanced lifestyle that isn't fully revolved around academics. ,3,2,236

0202B3446E2E,"Concluding Statement.I ask you to please vote against the electoral collage for the following three reasons:

The representitives dont amount to the number of individuals that voted.

The electoral collage is outdated and irrational

0350A994E363,Conclusion.The Electoral College should be changed because of how outdated it is. ,0,0,13
036F8E1EF7A2,"Conclusion.The Electoral College has been around for a long time. The Electoral College is a process which consists of the counting of the electoral votes by Congress, meetings of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the selection of electors. It consists of a total of five hundred and eight electors and a majority of two hundred and seventy votes are required for presidency. Electors are choosen by the candidates political party. When voting for presidential elections, you are also voting for your candidates electors too.

When the presidential elections are complete the govenor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" which lists all the candidates who ran for President and the names of all the electors and it also tells who won the presidency and the electors that will represent your state. The state conventions, state partys central comitee, and the presidential candidates, all pick the electors. ",3,1,151

03CD4C5553A4,"Conclusion.Also, our school offers an excellent class called health. Moreover, they tell us that we should exercise because it helps us in the long run. But, if we take that away because of grades the kids may become more lethargic and not being able to even keep up with a C average! The effects would make the child's grade lower and possibly their status as a student would drop also. ",3,2,71
03CECCDBCC09,Conclusion.I dissagree with the fact that the state wants to keep favor of electoral college. I think they should change the way the whole election is set up by using popular vote for the presedent of the united states ,5,0,40

0424AC66B7C7,"Conclusion.if it is a contructions zone, the car does not knowhow to get through it or manuver around it. A problem that might happen is you can tell the car where you want to go but it might not take you there. That can be a dangerous situation. If you have a driverless car, the driver is not going to pay attention to the road at al, so if something does happen in the car, the driver will not be paying attention enough to take control of the car. ",3,0,90
0424AC66B7C7,Conclusion.The driverless cars need more modifications ,0,0,7
0428DEB82659,Conclusion.So people might say that getting rid of the electoral college is the way to go because the congress have no say in the voting. The congress is part of the political system and they should be able to have the final say on who is President. ,5,0,48
0428DEB82659,"Conclusion.Also, the Electoral colllege requires a presidential candidate to have trans regiona, all arounf he country, appeal ",0,0,18

043E9B5AFC5F,Conclusion.It's a good idea because it benefits the public ,0,2,10
043E9B5AFC5F,"Conclusion.The public wants to know exactly who and what they are voting for, they want to know exactly what their vote means to the election. More than half of the time they don't notice what kind of an impact a vote can make or what exactly they are voting for. Also when they do elect a President, the end up getting mad over their finances or taxes because the President trhat they voted for affected it in a negative way. They wanted to elect him because they wanted a better economy, to benefit them, not to restrict them from not having what they want. ",3,2,105
043E9B5AFC5F,"Conclusion.We all don't want to vote and not know what kind of impact our vote can make. We want to know that we can make a difference on who we're voting for, or who we vote for. They want to know and be sure if they vote for lets say ""Billy Henderson"" that he will lower gas prices and boost the economy, make this world a better place and help all the needy, instead of ""Robert Metinguey"" who will maybe to this and maybe do that. We want to know for sure what we're voting on and how much of a difference it can make. Not to be worried about if it won't happen. ",3,0,115
046703375973,"Conclusion.the students are keeping up their grade, and when their grade is getting lower (to a low c) the coach talks to them, saying that they better be careful. it scares the students to be getting a c because that's the boundary line. they shoot for getting an A or B anyways so it wont make a difference. It is just going to scare the kids. Also by changing the grade average it is most likely going to bring down the team numbers. Not as many kids are going to try out because of that. changing even just a little thing makes a big difference, and changing this will make even a bigger difference. ",3,2,115

However, I believe there are new ways to look at the subject. ",4,0,46
04D653441263,"Conclusion.As a current student at a in person educational school, I have first-hand experience on how time consuming school may 6 be. An online education means that you are being told what you need to have done here before a certain time and, how you are expected to do so. It throws away the possibility of time consuming dialogue that students may have with other students or the teachers getting off topic with a personal story. Doing these little things that happen frequently can turn an 8 hour system into 3 hours. In the mist of giving these students 5 more hours in the day that is 5 more hours for students to work, hang out with friends, do chores and etc. These little things let us teenagers be teenagers just a little while longer. Adding to things such as, the employment rate, students taking college classes during high school, and the amount of teens volunteering. ",3,2,157

04F277F6562D,"Conclusion.For example, the Face was found in an area of Mars called Cydonia. Cydonia is actually known for its common Martian Mesas. This means that it isn't too shocking that it is natural. ",3,2,34

04F277F6562D,"Concluding Statement.There you have it. The Face sadly wasn't built by aliens, it was just a natural landform that happened to have some pretty neat features to it due to shadows. There is no way around it, because the pictures don't lie. It is even more obvious that it is a landform because ones just like it exist on Earth!

The author states ""the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better responce and control than a human driver could manage alone.""

05A6C6DF86A9,"Conclusion.With the loss of fellow classmates it can make an impact greater than most people think. Humans are social creatures which allows us to thrive when working and collaborating with one another. Now when your taken out of that environment and placed in an environment that forces you to do all the work alone it destroys your work speed and makes it far more difficult to process and absorb information because you don't have the different perspectives or incites your classmates could have given you. Not having classmates also could make it harder to interact with unfamiliar people because when your in class your always meeting and socializing with new and unique people, now being taken out of that your no longer exposed to any of these interactions meaning you would have to relearn these social skills which could be very challenging as a teenager which could lead to worse problems like being socially awkward ",3,2,156
05B3CD46C701,"Conclusion.¨Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers¨(9). Therefore, it is already hard enough to keep the drivers alert and watching the road while they are driving now, could you imagen how hard it would be to keep people alert when they have nothing to do? These laws are there to keep people safe and smart cars are the easy way to go not the safe way. Also, serious arguments would accure that would only cause problems not solve anything. Because what if this car gets into an accident while self-driving, would it be the drivers fault or the manufacture? Could you blame it on the driver and say they should have been more alert or say that the manufacture should have made/programed their cars better? These arguments and cases would be never ending, because almost all humans do not want to be saw as guilty so they would do and say anything to get off the hook. As to say, these smart driverless cars would do a lot more harm than help. ",3,2,188

We are also told the we have the freedom to vote once you reach certain requirements, like age and citizenship. However, are we really getting the freedom that is talked about? No. Because the Electoral College is present in today's society, our vote becomes pointless and meaningless.

This idea isn't and is referred to as distance learning. Distance learning already exists in most colleges such as Generic_School and has started to develop in high schools. Many have the impression that this could be the new way to do school work. Others believe that distance learning won't bring much of a change as it says it is and have a rather niche effect in schools ",4,2,123
0640FE8DF9D6,"Conclusion.Instead of students worrying about what work they're missing on their sick days they can open up their device and do the work from home. This same practice could also be used in scenarios such as snow days,tornadoes,floods or other bad weather that causes schools to shut down. This could also be the new way to combat schools having to add more school days to make up for the missed ones.

But if you don't want to hear it then that's ok with me and that walking on the green going to connections please give us a break that's why boys cut up all the time because you always say walk on the green it is making us cut up like that since Elementary school we didn't have to walk on the green but now we are in middle school we have to walk on the green, i mean come on TEACHER_NAME can you just at least give this school a break and don't you get me started on boys not pulling up there pants, as RELATIVE_NAME says on RELATIVE_NAME's big happy family pants on the ground got your pants on the ground looking like a fool with your pants on the ground can't turn around with the gold in your mouth RELATIVE_NAME remix what.

07397A3E9D8D,"Conclusion.Even from my own experience, when I'm given an assignment to do in class I finish it more quickly due to the resources I have in the classroom. When assignments are given at home, it takes me longer to complete this assignment because I tend to have lots of questions that can't be answered by my parents or the internet. Video chatting isn't the same as a face to face conversation with your teacher. What if the internet is down and you're not able to communicate with your online teacher, what do you do now? As a student, I know kids aren't going to try and solve the problem, this is just another excuse they can use to as why they did not complete their assignments. Attending class at home will cause more of a stress for students because they will find other things to do that can distract them from their work. In a classroom, you have one job and that's to get your work done. Less distractions are available in a classroom when compared to your own home. ",3,2,181
07397A3E9D8D,"Conclusion.If a student were to work from home, they would choose when they want to work and if they even feel like doing assignments that day. Having this schedule teaches them time management which helps them develop the technique for the future when planning out different things. My friend, Generic_Name, has a very hard time planning things such as hanging out with friends, when to complete assignments, etc. She learned how to manage a schedule that incorporates all of her needs and wants into her day. She is able to attend school, go to soccer practice, and still have time for her friends and family. This is one of many life lessons that attending school can give you. When people think of school they think of all the work they have to complete with no time in the day to do it. By developing this schedule it helps them manage their priorities first and helps them incorporate their wants as well. ",3,2,162
0741F0C1D776,Conclusion.COVID-19 is spreading across the world. Now this disease has killed more people than influenza has this year. Epidemiologists for the CDC are recommending that colleges across the country shut down their campuses and revert to online school so that they disperse the student population to lower the chances of the students getting infected. This suggestion has been readily accepted in colleges throughout the country. Soon public schools could follow the colleges' lead. More and more public schools are introducing a plethora of online classes. Many students are now able to do classwork and take assessments online as well as conference with their teachers from the comfort of their home. ,4,2,111

First of all, with online classes students would be able to interact with their teachers on a more personal level. ",0,0,21
0741F0C1D776,"Conclusion.Many employers in this hyper-technological world are looking for employees that will be able to keep up with new technologies as well as help their business grow. While students are at school, they have access to technology, but this access is limited and most often very basic for most people. If schools' education was offered online, many students would rapidly become accommodated with new and more complex programs and applications. Teachers could require logging of time spent studying on spreadsheets, or taking screen shots of research, as well as making projects on three-dimensional design software for every student that they have. So many things in the classroom would have to be transferred online, making students who graduate highly valued to any employer looking to hire somebody. Highschool students who become adept at using online applications would be beneficial for a student and future employers.

129427624B81,"Conclusion.Here is a prime example, in the 2000 election Al Gore won the popular vote but because he had less electoral votes than Bush he unfourtunetly lost the election. According to Bradford Plumer ""over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" It seems rather logical that if somebody gains the most votes in an election that the country would prefer that canidate to be the president. For that reason alone the reader should side with the idea to abolish the electoral college. Now besides somebody receiving more or less electoral votes, perhaps the candidates tied. In this case it gets thrown to the House Of Representitives which will cause a Wyoming Rep. with 500,000 voters to have just as much say as a California Rep. with 35,000,000 voters. All a tie would do is corrupt the voting system even more than it is. For those reasons there should be an indefinite ban on the electoral college. ",3,2,168
129427624B81,"Conclusion.Some may argue that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president but regions do have the power to swing an election in an enourmous way. An effect of the winner take all system is candidates not going to certain states if they know they can not win it. This can basically stop some voters from wasting time and voting because they may feel there personal vote would make no difference. In the 2000 election ""17 states did not see candidates at all."" according to Bradford Plumer. How could somebody possibly feel engaged in an election if whoever is running finds there vote unimportantant to them winning the election. ",3,2,113

This process is easier for most individuals beacause you do not have to sit in a room, for hours, counting up millions of votes; all you have to do is count up the elector's votes in stead. This process is what our founding fathers established in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. How can you be a qualified citizen, arent we all the same? I know that the electoral college consists of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president.

In 2013, BMW made a vehicle that could run the car on its own, but the driver still had to hold on to the wheel. Many other cars have become semi autonomous, but require the driver to take over when there are different conditions, such as roadwork or there is an accident. Some of these semi auatonomous cars alert the driver when they need to take over, either by an indicator, physical vibration, or simply by announcing that the driver needs to take over. What if the driver falls asleep and the car fails to wake the driver to take control of the car? How safe is the car then? ",3,2,135
1ADE96A7A4D3,"Conclusion.Does the manufactorer who made the car get blamed, or does the driver who purchased it take responsibility? I personally belive that these cars are an assumed risk and that if the car is in an accident, that both the driver and the manufacterer are to blame. I believe that the driver could have attempted to do something to change the cars path, but it is more so the manuacturers fault becasue their car failed to stay in its own lane and out of the way of other traffic. The blame also depends on who was inc ontrol at the time of the accident, if the driver had control of the car, it is his or her fault. But if the computer was running the car, then it is the manufacturers fault. ",3,2,133

1BF9AA238FCE,"Conclusion.If there is no one available in person to help with these issues, online classes become useless. Yet, these factors play a crucial role in the student's development as a person. They teach the student discipline and time management.

1C088E6CD17E,"Conclusion.The whole purpose of providing the youth with education is to be able to train them to become independent enough to be self-sufficient in the real world. In a school or classroom environment, they learn valuable teamwork skills that allow them to cooperate and collaborate with other individuals about how to approach an issue, overcome challenges, and propose a solution. This eventually leads to the building of bonds and relationships that could impact an individual's life or mental health, whereas online schooling encourages the opposite effect of this. By physically going to school, these individuals nurture their abilities to be problem-solvers and natural thinkers. Additionally, some students may not take online classes seriously as opposed to physically showing up for class. For an example, online students may not require a time constraint and does not require the students to be properly dressed for the ""class."" Sometimes, the individual may present themselves to an online class in their pajamas because they woke up an hour ago. This does not exemplify sophistication nor does the class seem respected. On the other hand, if the student were to show up to school, they would look much more prepared and willing to learn. This highlights the difference between individuals who value their education and the ones who do not. ",3,2,217

It also gies people restrictions that had already had problems or that had did something something that was'nt alowd.

Students would not have to deal with the harsh environment of a school and they would get ability to decide their class pacing better then in school teaching. I believe that all teachers want is for their students to succeed, but how can a student excel when the school system is dampening their motivations with poor environments. As a student myself, I can say with absolute certainty that I would benefit from having school from home. I would not have to feel the pressure of a harsh testing environment and I would never have to deal with teachers, who were frustrated that I could not complete their too many assignments on their due dates. Students need fluidity, and the rigid structure of our school system today is not helping them to succeed. The only way that I see that students would be able to act on full capacity would be to switch to a completely online school system.  ",1,2,182

2A52459E72AD,"Conclusion.Another example of why attending online classes is easy and more convenient is when I was already late for class and then I got stuck in traffic on the way to my Spanish 3 class, resulting in me missing the entirety of the class. Had I been registered for the same class but online, I would have never missed the Spanish 3 final exam. For these reasons, online classes can be much easier, convenient, and beneficial when dealing with life's daily obstacles. ",3,2,83
2A52459E72AD,"Conclusion.Another example of why online and video conferencing classes are beneficial to a student with an illness or disability is illustrated the time my Generic_Name was in college and got an bad spinal and neck injury, allowing her to not be able to walk for months and having to be in a wheel chair. It was very difficult for her to attend her English, Psychology, and AB Calculus classes due to this disability. Her counselor recommended that she stayed home for a few months to recover and continue attending her very important classes via video conference while her professor was teaching. Ultimately, had she not reaped the benefits from attending her classes through video at home, it would have been an enormous task to make it to her classes on a daily basis.

2ABF91C208B8,"Conclusion.Under the 23rd Amendement of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allowed to have three electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. The eletoral college consists of 538 electors. The majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. If we switched to the popular vote, it would be nothing like how the Electoral College works. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice pressident, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress.

2ABF91C208B8,"Conclusion.I dont believe anybody would be happy because thats not a fair way to choose how our President, Vice president and the Representatives should be picked. We pick a new president every four years so why don't we just keep it the way it been for a long time so we don't mess everybody up on their decisions. Another reaosn why I don't care to switch is because what if we run into a run-off election. If we run into one of those it would be hard to get out of it just because we wouldn't know what to do. Popular vote would also run us into "" swing votes. "" If we were to get stuck in a swing vote, everybody would have to re vote and then pray it dosen't happen again. ",3,0,135

My friend sometimes has to leave school early just to go to her job and works eight hour shifts, five days a week and stays up to do her homework or sometimes isn't able to complete it.

2B7612A3D793,Conclusion.Sources from source 2: The Indefensible Electoral college: why even the best - laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumet. Reason 1  explains that many electors could ruin the president campaign and Reason 2 states many elector go for big states to cast in more votes other than small states. ,3,0,54
2B7612A3D793,"Conclusion.Many may not realize but when they vote they're not voting for the president, they're voting for state electors ",0,2,20
2B7612A3D793,"Conclusion.Source 2 quoted "" Because of the -take- all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Even though you would like to vote for your campaign the electors may not even visit other sates because they may think the other campaign has a better shot at getting more votes, but they do not know that maybe spoken words for the president may get more votes. also many may not even see any ad for the campaign, for example "" During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" The author explains that many electors don't even see most staes because they are small states and they may not get as much votes compared to larger states. ",3,2,165
2B7612A3D793,"Concluding Statement.Electoral College should be abolished because the electors may help ruin the president election and large states are not vistied or spoken to from the president other than small states. Electoral college may seem an unfair disadvantage for most voters many of their campaign that they want to win can be rather at a disadvantage or advantage depending on their electors,  many electors may betray their campaign because they're not pubilicly held in office. Lastly the disadvantage is that many voters want to see what and how they are going to change or improve their well being, but most electors and campaigns do not visit the states that want view and know the candidates better. The electoral College should be abolished for the matter of the voter and the United States of America. In my opinion we should be allowed to vote on our own, for example instead of voting for an elector we should just vote on the type of campagin whose better and meet our daily bases needs.  ",1,2,172

Because of the quirks of the electoral college, won the popular vote but the electoral college still has its defenders. The electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in return elect the president. Although the electoral vote may be unfair to voters it gives the president a better chance of winning the election. There is a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral Colege vote but not likely for the popular vote. For this is because the winning candidates share of the Electoral vote exceeds it's share of the popular vote. For exemple, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of popular votes for him and Romney, in the 2012's election. ",3,1,143

The features previously cited as being used as tiem fillers can also be quickly changed to inform the driver that they need to take over: ""Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over.""

2C2CF03355C9,Conclusion.When a college goes to accept a child they don't just look at grades. They look at what extra curricular activities they do. Community service shows the colleges that the kids will help out society if they want. This is also an EXTRA curricular activity so they weren't forced to do this. They did it because they wanted to and that is a great way to look at a student. The kids will also be more likely to be accepted by higher ranked college. ,3,2,85

The Electoral College doesn't deserve its defenders. 2000 proved it, the voters have spoken up, and it is indisputably irrational to continue to rely on it. The system has been around for a while, and it will stay in place for the next few years, most likely.

2EDC00346850,"Conclusion.Sports are a very important factor to many schools.

Many kids take sports for granted, and don't focus on their school work.

2EDC00346850,"Concluding Statement.The time has come to decide whether or not to make a requirement of a B average amongst students in order to participate in sports or other activities.

This requirement would be beneficial to our school's community because it would encourage students to do well in the classroom, more students would have a B or higher grade average, and the sports teams would be much smarter and more successful as a result.

So, Mr. Principal, go and make a requirement of a B or higher grade average in order to participate in sports or other activities! ",1,2,98

They contain a numerous amount of sensors and alert systems. If there was something that would harm you while in the driverless car, the car would either be able to get out of the situation more effectively than an experienced driver, or would be able to alert the driver to take over and the driver would manually get out of the situation.

In the passage it says that the Google driverless cars contain many sensors. Some of those sensors include, the sensor on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor.

This shows first hand how safe the driverless cars are. The Driverless cars have so many built in sensors that even the most dangerous situation can be avoided while in a driverless car. ",3,2,161

For instance, if the people vote for candidates for the electoral college, and the majority of them are not what the majority of the people wanted, or they lied about being pledged to a candidate for president, then there is still a chance that the candidate that the people did want could be elected, by the national popular vote. Also, the people that are against the electoral college shouldn't be, because the electoral college is not definite. Just because the electoral colleg votes for a certain candidate, does not guarantee that the overall national vote will be that person. ",3,2,144

Exercise keeps students healthy and when a student competes in sports, they are exercising. Every gym teacher I've ever had has always told us how daily exercise is important and I've seen many commercials that say growing kids and teens need at least one hour of exercise each day to keep physically fit and healthy. Sports also build confidence. When a team wins, it boosts a person's confidence. When you are confident, you feel that you can do anything and succeed. Sports provide healthy exercise and confidence to students, but if you keep this rule, you'll be depriving it from us. ",3,2,133

A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total of numbers of votes are 538 is an even number but it is highly unlikely. The new president will have no regard for their interests,that he really isn't their president. The most thoughtful voters should be the the ones to decide the election. So other being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign tham a samll state does. Voters in a presidential elections are people who want to express a political prefernce rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.            ",3,1,123

318F40822873,"Conclusion.While in the classroom, it is difficult for teachers to go at a pace that isn't too slow or too fast for every single student since not every student learns at the same pace. I consider myself a relatively slow learner and writer. Therefore, there have been several instances where my teachers would be lecturing and giving notes, and I found myself missing key information because the teacher was not allowing time for us to write it down. However, unlike my other teachers, my history teacher will make us take notes at home. In this instance, taking notes and learning from home, helped me retain and learn the information better than if I were at school because I was not constantly stressing about the teacher switching the slides, and therefore, potentially missing key concepts. Giving students the opportunity to learn from home allows students to make sure they get all of the necessary information that they may need for later success on a test. It also gives students time to be able to make sure that they understand the information on the notes, rather than just typing or writing it down without understanding the meaning behind it. In addition, some of my teachers make assignments due at the end of class, despite some students, like myself, not being able to finish within the time constraint ",3,2,226
318F40822873,"Conclusion.Therefore, I think learning from home provides the best learning environment for every student to do well in their education, since they don't have to constantly be overshadowed with the stress of time on important assignments. At home, students are able to ensure that they turn in quality work that will help improve their grades rather than hurt it because of a time constraint. Students should be given the opportunity to take classes from home because not every student learns identically and as quickly as others. ",0,2,87

3214BA8B26E6,"Concluding Statement.Overall Mr. Senator, I believe that the Electoral College should not be used to determine who becomes the President of the United States instead they should use popular vote.

346D40A69BBF,"Conclusion.The Electoral College is a process, consider a place. Our founding fathers established it in the our country`s Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by voting in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

The process of the Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors. They vote for th President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The Electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state`s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation, one for each member in the House of Representives plus two for your Senators. Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia(DC) is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. Every candidate running for President in your state has his or her own electors group.

The electors generally are chosen by the candidate`s political party, but the states laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, you help help choose your state`s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate`s electors. Than after the presidential election, your governor prepared a "" Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors.

350376FA39BD,"Conclusion.The Electoral College is a process. This process consists of the selection of electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice presient.

""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" (Office of the Federal Register 2). This system was created by the founding fathers as a compromise between the congressional vote and the popular vote. However there was a reason for this new, seperated voting system. During their time the founding fathers where among the most educated men in the country. Back then education was not standard and very few people could read or write. The founding fathers did not want uneducated citizens voting on the individual who would lead the country. So they created a system where the uneducated would vote for a group of educated men, who would in turn vote on a president. Thus the electoral college was born. ",3,2,172

The 1960 election is not the only case of this either. It happened again when Hawaii sent two slates of electors to congress, and in other various cases electors did not vote for their designated candidate. Finally there is the case of the 2000 election, where Al Gore won the popular vote, but lost the Electoral College! If just one person decides to go against the grain, everything gets thrown off.

3712A5E56380,"Conclusion.The article, ""What Is the Electoral College?"" written by the Office of the Federal Register states, ""Most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"". That is not fair to other voters who don't vote for the popular candidate in their state; they don't receive any electors. Additionally, most candidates only advertise and visit ""swing"" states. ""Swing"" states are the states that usually determine the outcome of the election. ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" written by Bradford Plumer says, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad"". It's unjustifiable that simply because you have fewer electors in your state, you don't get to watch your candidates campaign. As previously mentioned, each state has a different number of electoral votes. It all depends on the population. For example, Texas, with a huge population has 38 electors, while Maine only has 4. The article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid out defenses of the system are wrong"" states, ""Beacuse each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"". Why do some states have more representatives than others just because of their population? It's not fair to the smaller states. It is true that the bigger states have more people in them, needing more representation, however, the smaller states have as much to say as the big ones. ' ",3,2,284

Therefore, students attending traditional public schools are alotted time, such as lunch or study hall, to hang out with friends and strengthen their interpersonal relationships. It is for these same reasons that most schools host memorable events outside of their eight-hour days for students to enjoy.

Another example is that people sometimes down want to do certain activities because their boring. With required community service that will have to do things that they normally wouldn't do. By doing these things they build character and self esteem. This will help them in the future with doing homework, getting into a good college, and even with wanting to do community service again.

According to Bradford Plumer in his article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" in the early 1960s, people who favored races being seperated in society were almost able to replace Democratic electors with a new set of electors who supported the opposite party. Also, some corrupt electors who are not pleased with the popular vote will simply vote for whomever they please. Electors clearly have trouble being trusted and there is obviously some extreme dislike for the system we have now. The Electoral College also causes some problems when instances like a tie in the electoral vote come about. In this case, a tie in the Electoral College would be thrown to the House of Representatives, who would then vote for the President. The Electoral College brings about uneccessary problems that could all be avoided if the country converted the way of electing to election by popular vote. ",3,2,171

3B9A70FC3744,"Conclusion.As Source 1 states, this proportional representation is only done by Maine and Nebraska, but it makes it so that one party wont win the state, it is reigional in the state meaning that more people are represented through this. The winner take all system is too harsh, and can discount many people in swing and regular states. As Source 3 stated, the larger states need to be left alone to represent the US population. Proportional representation allows this with the ability to include even more opinions. With this informatin, it is easy to see how proportional representation will preserve the equality that popular vote represents. ",3,2,107

Some of these people are not even U.S. citizens. Yes, some states do require to so identification, although others do not. A direct election would be more specified and easier for people to choose and use. Some people overlook these detail while others enjoy the system because of the power it provides them.

3D7740BCAA23,"Conclusion.The Electoral College consists of 538 electors.  With majority of 270 votes are needed so there is a good chance of getting a fair shot to win.  Each candidate running for president in a state has to have there own group of electors which eguals out the odds.  The electors are chosen by the candidates political party.  In most states they have a winner takes all system but Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportion.

The certificate of ascertainment also declares the winning presidental candidate in the state and shows which electors will be representing your state at the metting of the electors which helps us to know who had won the presidental election.  Voting for a state election of who will turn elected for president. When voting you would have to vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors to pledge for Kerry.

Voting for a president is like voting for a state elector.  Even though a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible it has only happened in 2000 but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote.  The reason is that the winning candidate shares the Electoral College invariably exceeds his shares of the popular vote.  The Electoral college requires an apresidental candidate to have transregional appeal.

The residents of the other religions are likely to feel disenfranchised and that their votes does not count and that the new president will have know regard for their interests.  That he is not really there president.  The winner of all methods of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates like as seen in the election of 2012.  They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters on average and that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidate as the most thoughful voter should be the one to decide the election.

The Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constituion.  Having the electoral College avoids the problem of electiong in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.  It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potental voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state, Democrats in Texas for example or Republicans in California.

Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee and is rarely betrayed, however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote than Bush yet fewer electoral votes.  As some would say the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.  The best arguments in favor of it are most likely assertions without much basis in reality.     ",3,1,469

The car will be able to sense other cars, pedestrians, and landscape obastacles.

The driverless car will also be able to handle road situations better than a human would.

Since 2009, the driverless cars have been able to navigate over half a million miles without a crash.

Along with the car's safety, it is also more efficient than a normal car.

The driverless car would use half the fuel of today's taxis and allow more flexibility than a bus, making them the ideal mode of transport.

Even though it is driverless, the car also requires human control.

The driverless car will be able to steer, break, and accelerate on its own, but it will alert the driver when the situation requires.

The human driver must take over in situations such as navigating construction zones or accidents.

Even though the car is not completely self-driving, it allows for the human driver to ultimately remain in control of the situation.

With the driverless car's ability to analyze and respond to its surroundings while allowing human control, it will be the safest and most efficient car of the future. ",3,2,205

42D8CCA3643E,"Conclusion.Adding onto getting work done, many students prefer working in an environment special or more comfortable to them. One major reasoning for that is one's medical conditions. Nowadays, many public schools offer a special education program, but to many, the system might not exactly meet their requirements. Many handicap students need special transportation, seating, and feeding, which schools may not be able to provide. They also require alert attention at all times because anything could happen to cause them discomfort, pain, or even to fall down. Other students going through a health issue may find schooling at home to be rather more comfortable due to the same reasons. At home, the students will have their family members to look and care for them. Besides the staff not being able to properly handle students in need of altunitive care, the, ""regular,"" students attending the school can also be an issue. Kids of today are not the nicest and love tearing others down on their insecurities. Bullying could be a serious concern to many special education students. ",3,2,177

441A5D13BCF3,"Conclusion.The number of electors in the Electoral College consits of 538 electors in total, which makes a tie completley possible, although it has never happened, in the past only a few more votes were required to create this unlikley problem ",0,2,41
441A5D13BCF3,"Conclusion.According to source 3, paragraph 18, Richard A. Posner claims that, ""A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number, but it is highly unlikley..."" There's a shockingly short ammount of votes required to turn an election into a situtation where both canidates have an even number of votes, a problem almost occured in 1976, that were if, according to source #2, paragraph #12, Bradford Plumer, ""a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way."" Those may look as if they are big numbers, however in comparison to the amount of voters in each state, these are not large amounts of people who needed to vote the other way. In comparison, the number of representatives is determined by the number of members in your congressional delegation, the amount of electors per state is fair. Still, however, the event of a tie would cause a lot of issues within our country, and would be relieved if the winner was elected by popular vote. 
",3,2,183
441A5D13BCF3,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion, the Electoral College seems unconstitutional, since a variety of issues can occur due to the many problems that could potentially occur. The United States should shift into a more reasonable and logical means of electing our president in our Republic, where everybody is equal. The Electoral College should no longer decide the president based on the possibility of a tie, the possibility for betrayal of trust and disputes due to how close the votes are. The system should change to where the popular opinion should  decide on the president of the United States of America, making people believe that their vote will be fairly counted. ",1,2,109

451D81265E8E,"Conclusion.Faith in a certain outcome of the presidential election ensures that the vote has as little complications as possible, and is a reason the Electoral College is necessary ",0,2,29
451D81265E8E,"Conclusion.According to source one, ""What Is The Electoral College?"", each political party has it's own set of electors that equal the amount of congressional delegates per state. Usually each state has a ""winner-take-all"" method, so the presidential candidate that gets majority in your state will get all of the electors that represent their party, not just most of them. This is beneficicial to the outcome of the election becuase it makes the ability for a candiate to get majority vote much simpler. There is less of a possibility of a tie, or an outcome where no candidate wins. Source 3, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing president"", states that ""even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state..."" , therefore allowing the candidate to secure all votes to their side, instead of having the votes divided on the line of majority rule, and causing rifts between Electoral College voters.

451D81265E8E,"Conclusion.The passage uses individual instances, like the fact that in 1960, segrigationists in Lousiana nearly appointed Democratic electors that would vote against their candidate, or that in rare instances, ""faithless"" electoral voters would vote for the other side. ",3,2,39

4722B4D2C6E7,"Conclusion.A student's home is a place for relaxation and minimal work. When a person thinks about relieving stress at the end of the day, they think about going home. At home, it's easy to get distracted by the little things. It may just be a pet or the TV, but all of these things result in taking important learning time away from a student's day. At school, a student doesn't have time to get distracted. Lessons are taught and good amounts of work are assigned so a student stays busy. For example, if a student that learns from home has to write an essay, they are more likely to get distracted by the things in their home then get it done. However, a student that learns at school would get their essay done, knowing that it's easier to stay on task then get behind because of distractions. Having less distractions isn't the only positive of learning at school though. A student also gets to work on projects that will help them in their future lives. ",3,2,176

4AFC0853D08D,Conclusion.I would have blame the manfacturer company because they said that the car is supose to brake themselves if danger is near or coming up . So if the owner was hurt then it would've been on manufacturer company all because they said that this car had sensors that could alert the drivers. Also which leads to another point lets say that the sensors fail without the driver knowing and she was driving a little bit reckless then that would been her fault and the cars ,3,0,86

4B6A52E23DE9,"Conclusion.Each state gets one vote and then the electors can choose who they want for president. In source two it states that the electoral college consists of 538 electors and the most amont of elecrtoral votes is 270, in order to pick an president. Also in source two it states that the number of electors we have equals to the amount of members of congress we have. I propose a new system by only letting the American people select our president by votes counted all up by each state, for example if we didn't have have electoral college,  then it would be a fair vote because people votes would count the number that adds up with all votes for one candidates that will oppose another candidates and there would be technically no tie it would either ,more or less, but if we still had the electoral college then the vote would not be equally fair becuse if the majority of a state for examlpe  chose republican candidate, then that would be vague becuse some people choose democratic and there vote did not really count. but without the electoral collge, than everyones vote counts and each candidates gets vote from every one, not only electoral. ",3,2,205
4B6A52E23DE9,"Conclusion.for example if one state candidate was choosen for republican and they were ""faithless"" as it says in source two, and chose the democratic party it would be very unfortunate for the republicans because than there would be no point of the votes the republican supporters have voted for. It only comes once every four years, this is very important to the american people, on choosing who they want for the future of america. ",3,2,75

4FE5B872FE61,"Conclusion.My first piece of evidence for this is that driverless cars are machines, and despite having a notoriously bad reputation for failing at times due to some error during the design process, machines do not tire and do not grumble about watching their surroundings; they also need not be perfect, only better than a person to become favorable as a driver. My second piece of evidence comes from, once again, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" when it was stated that ""enetertainment and information systems that use heads up displays [...] can be turne doff instantly when the driver needs to take over [in the case that the car senses that its own computing devices are not enough to handle a situation]"".

The Electoral College is a system that allots a certain amount of electoral votes to each state.

A candidate must recieve 270 out of 538 possible votes. The candidate the electoral votes of a state go to is decided by the majority vote of each individual state. In all states but Maine and Nebraska give a candidate the entirety of their votes if the majority of its citizen votes for them (source 1) ",3,2,103

The citizens of the United States will feel as if they aren't apart of this country, not giving the rights or freedom this country promised them. The citizens will feel like their votes do not count, when they have there opinion on something the new president will have no interest towards it, this means to us that he isn't really a president.

52D49831B279,"Conclusion.Furthermore, a lot of students live further away from the school, and a lot of the time, rely on the bus to get to and from school. On days where the student were to sleep in late, or the bus doesn't come, the student would have to stay home and miss class. While some have the option to ask a relative for a ride, others do not, causing issues at home and at school for those who are unable to make it due to transportation issues. ",3,2,87
52D49831B279,"Conclusion.Being given the option to work on school at home, students would not have to rush to find a ride if the bus doesn't show, and waking up late for the bus would not be as big of an issue ",0,2,41
52D49831B279,"Conclusion.On the other hand, some argue that students will use the distance learning less as a tool, but more as a crutch, so that they don't have to attend classes and can stay home whenever they want.

Taxi drivers could take someone anywhere or your friend could be under the influence. Driverless cars are safer because they could take you where you need to go safely.

I thin k they will think it is all right to have a phone in book bags just not with you at all times. ,3,0,105
53A912957FE2,Conclusion.I would tell them that the face is not created by aliens because if it was there would be a sign of some sort like there could be possibley more then one of the faces. Also there could have maybe been a symbol of some sort that could tell you or us that it may be out of this world. So studies tell us it isn't a alien monument because well when you look at the picture or image that was taken in 2001. ,4,0,85
53A912957FE2,Conclusion.It looks more like a rock or a mesa not something made. ,5,0,13
53A912957FE2,Conclusion.Yes it may look a alien or something out in space made it ,2,1,14
53A912957FE2,"Concluding Statement.So in conclusion it is not a alien made face it simply in a mesa or a landmark on Mars. The proof is in the article when you see the 3 picutes that were taken to prove it wasn't a alien made artifact. No matter how cool it would be if it was not to mention that it could make NASA famous or rich it just doesn't have the proof you need to be a alien artifact. If you look more into the passage it even says it was not a alien made artiffact. Yes this face was very famous it even says ""The ""Face"" on Mars has since been a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, apperered in books, magazines, and even radio shows."" (5). See how famous that face was 25 years ago is amazing but it still doesn't mean it was a alien made artiffact. So in final say it is not a alien made face and nor will there be enough proof its just a landmark on Mars that was very popular to people everywhere!           ",1,2,185

542FD18E9ADA,Conclusion.It is hard to argue that there are some problems with the Electoral College. ,2,2,15
542FD18E9ADA,"Conclusion.""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote."" (the Office of the Federal Register). People must remember that this system is a compromise for the election and that any change could lead to problems among the government again. The public must also remember that ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee"".(Richard A. Posner). This system also can often prevent disputes. ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible...but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share or the popular vote."" (Richard A. Posner). Along with the fewer disputes, it also creates standards for the candidate. "" The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal...This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" (Richard A. Posner). Another benefit to this system is that it causes voters to pay closer attention to the election. ""Voter in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign."" (Richard A. Posner). Along with the more aware voters, the Electoral College is also very beneficial to the big states. ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution."" (Richard A. Posner). And lastly, the Electoral Collee helps avoid run-off elections. ""There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner."" (Richard A. Posner). To sum it all up, there are many benefits to the Electoral College. ",3,2,336

Working from home brings in a couple essential factors, that a lot of times are hard to find at schools which range from comfort, focus, and familiarity. One basic aspect that is often pointed to when talking about comfort at school versus comfort at home is the amount of noise pollution. While at school, you are often surrounded by twenty five to thirty other students who are all chatting and creating noise pollution in your work environment. However, while working at home, there is rarely any noise pollution because of the vastly lesser amount of people in your work environment. This more focused and comfortable work environment can allow students to strive and gain success rather then be out of concentration and disturbed at a school. ",3,2,155

Well for starters, under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but vote for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.

5E1DEB2AAE39,"Concluding Statement.America was meant to become a democracy, and if we keep the colleg, it will always keep us from becoming it. I agree that the Electoral College was one of the best Sytems created. Unfourtunatley, not everything was meant to work out in the long run. Jobs, careers, school, buisnesses, relationships, and the Electoral College. It has made vital mistakes that has caused us not to be able to have much faith in it anymore. It was good in the begining, but now its time for it to come to an end.     ",1,0,94
5E461378597B,Conclusion.it has been that way for many years and it has worked alright look at jhon f kennedy we had the electoral colege system in place look how it turned out. Another example george washington look at him first president and his term turned out great so we had a bunch of sucsess with this system its not worth changing with the results it got. ,3,0,66
5E461378597B,Conclusion.for example the article said the electoral college consists of the selection for the electors this means congress hs some time to meet and think in wich to vote. the passage said the electoral college consists of 538 electors so this means they got to reach a consensus and with a concensus everything is put to tghought so the bad things of each candatite is put to tgought. ,3,1,69
5E461378597B,Conclusion.so this system does work and when it does the results have been great. the article did say this winner take all system is unfair to voters but this system has shown great results with various presidints. ,3,0,38

5E9964522D41,"Conclusion.The self driving car has begun implementing technology that can revolutionize a car's self awarness. For example the article states, ""spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3D model of the car's surroundings."" Unlike the human eye, the LIDAR radar sees anything and everything; not only does it never miss a single detail, but it also has a 360 degree view that current drivers simply do not possess. These sensors are expecially useful when backing up and driving backwards, as many drivers struggle with getting a full view of what goes on behind them. However, with the LIDAR radar, this problem is eliminated, making backwards driving easier. Putting radar into the drivers seat is not so much about losing the human touch of driving, but getting a more accurate perspective on the road. ",3,2,144
5E9964522D41,"Conclusion.Secondly, the technology is finally in a place where self driving cars are becoming a feasible economic option. ",0,2,19
5E9964522D41,"Conclusion.With so many deaths accounted to texting and driving, the idea is that people would be able to safely text when the car drives itself certainly has its appeal. However, when the car needs a human touch, ""displays [texting] can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over-something not avalible to drivers trying to text with a cell phone."" Shutting off the display would force drivers to pay attention to the road during tricky situations and reduce the number of car crashes. Secondly, the use of sensors helps detect and prevent crashes. The article says, ""sensors have become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out of control skids or rollovers. This information from the sensor can cause the car to apply breaks on individual wheels,"" which could stop potential dangers in their tracks that the driver may not be aware of. In the end, a self autonomus car is always vigilant and is never distracted, making it safer than having a human driver. ",3,2,173

603108B7285B,"Conclusion.In 1960, a group of segretationists in the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in removing electors who supported John F. Kennedy with those who opposed him. If this had happened, all of the states electoral votes would have been cast by biased electors, rather than by the actual voters themselves. In the same year, Hawaii sent two state electors to congress instead of one. It is sad that we maintain a system in our government that continues to let issues like this arise. Along with issues with the electors, why is it that the size of a state automatically gives it a bigger advantage in elections? Texas and California are the most two saught-after swing states in every election. Candidates will do everything they can to win over those electoral votes. But what about the little states? Many of the smaller states do not get visited by candidates. Some never even see campaign ads. This system we are using creates target areas in the United States that are more valuable in elections than others. This is in no way fair to the voters in smaller states, despite having the exact same rights as voters of bigger states. ",3,2,197

603108B7285B,"Conclusion.Many people remember the problem of the 2000 presidential election. The Electoral College had very effectively exemplified its flaws and unefficient ways of opperating. Al Gore and George Bush were running apposed, and despite winning the overall popular vote in the country, Gore lost the election to Bush. Bush had received the most electoral votes, therefore winning him the presidency. Basically, despite the fact that more citizens chose Gore to be president, Bush won out. In our constitution it is written that citizens of the United States have an unwavering right to vote and select who gets put into office. In this case, it sounds more like the number of electoral votes has an unwavering right to select who gets put into office. ",3,2,124

605DDEFB7A40,"Conclusion.As I stated before, each state has an amount of points based on the population, which in turn affect how much you help your desired party. Seems reasonable, right? You would think that the more the population, the more impact it has on the election. ",2,0,46
605DDEFB7A40,"Conclusion.But big states, like California, Texas, and Florida have some of the most points, so if you were to win those, you already have more than one hundred points. Candidates would try to just seek out those jumbo prizes and systematicaly try to win the largest behind ""the Big Four"". If someone was reading this and wanted the Electoral College, they could say that the big states would still have an advantage with more voters, and that is right, but they wouldn't be as big of prizes. So the election turns from a voice of the people, speaking up for a new leader, and turns into a mad chase to get the biggest prizes before the other party, like a game of Monopoly. In Monopoly, you buy areas with your money, and when someone lands on that space you own, they have to pay you. The places ath the end of the board have the priciest cost, but the best outcome. You can also build property on spaces to make the enemy players pay more. If you were to buy those, you practically win the game. On the other hand, the spaces at the begining are basiclly worthless, costing about 100 dollars and giving you about 1000. Those are like the small states, that have almost no value to the election, and the big states are worth a lot. ",3,2,230
605DDEFB7A40,"Concluding Statement.In America, the people should be able to feel responsible for their country's future, and not feel as if their state doesn't matter. My own words might not be able to change peoples' minds, but I'm sure the votes aren't tied.  ",1,0,43

If all the kids have a cell phone with them at school then there's going to be less education in there life because they are not dong what they are suppose to be doing, they are texting or calling when they are suppose to be doing there work and learning about history or math ",3,0,72
607AB7FA0E57,Conclusion.I feel that if you let the students bring there cell phones to school it could start something or bring trouble. ,0,2,22
607AB7FA0E57,Conclusion.Yes kids bring phones to school when they are not suppose to but not all of them use it during class. They only bring there phones for when school is over and if they need to call there mom or dad. I only bring my phone so that if something bad were to happening after school when i am walking home or if i need to call for a question i have my cell phone. I have never used my phone during school because it is going to get me off task. ,3,1,93
607AB7FA0E57,Concluding Statement.I hope that you will keep cell phones from use in school. I know that students will be mad at first but they will see when you let them bring there phones how unfocused it is during school. Kids have a lot of things going on in there life and when they have a cell phone i bet they talk about how they feel to there friends. Also it is a off task thing because of un answer questions they might have from a friend or some one. So please hear me out and do not let students use cell phones at all in school.      ,1,0,107
60C439A28A94,"Conclusion.For example, schools have their students build collaboration skills through group projects; online schooling or video conferencing does not provide this same benefit of collaboration. When a student is working from the comfort of their own home, they are not actively collaborating with other students; it is essential for students to have the ability to cooperate with other people in the real world. These group projects add the benefit of teaching students how to work with others in order to get certain tasks done, preparing them for when they have to inevitably work with other people they may not necessarily like. Online schooling is largely independent, and requires the student to rely on themselves and only themselves, while classroom settings teach both independence and dependence. Students must learn how to work with other people so that they can learn how to deal with individuals who are difficult to cooperate with, and so that they learn to rely on others when in need of assistance.

63587869CADC,"Conclusion.The presidential election most have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidental candidate. And after the presidential election, yout governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"". Listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party.

According to Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole they agreed on abolishing the electoral college . The electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency over 60% of voters. What that means? 60% of the people didn't agree with the electoral college. The single best argument against the electoral college is what they might call the disaster factor. Us the American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was  the biggest election crisis in a century. The state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors , and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.

At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each states they know they have no chance of winning , focosing only on the tight races on the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 compaign seventeen states did not see the canditates at all. Including Rhode Island and South Carolina. Also  voters in 25 of the lqrgest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. The electoral college is unfair, outdated , and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertionw without much basis in reality. Bob Dole was right. Abolish the elctoral college!

In conclusion, The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism , a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigtee; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. ",3,1,324

63765DD9525D,"Conclusion.People are being entirely ignored by the powerful politicians that are supposed to represent them. That doesn't sound very democratic and fair to me. People begin to feel discouraged and that their vote doesn't count, and this is quite close to the being the case. Only one-half of elligable citizens voted in the 2012 election, which means that one half didn't.

The popular opinion of our people is that the government is out to get us, and there's not much evidence to contradict that. The electoral college system allows for the government to be run by men who didn't fairly win over our country, and isn't accurately representing our views. It's rife with corruption, and allows money to buy power. If we remove this system in favor of a popular vote election would encourage more popular policy, make our government closer to the people, and have little to no negative impact on our country.

Another reason is that students might also drop out or move schools so they can continue playing sports.

If students don't have sports they are also less likely to get enough exercise which could cause more obesity in the school.

Some students rely on sports as a chance to spend time with their friends, so if sports are cut out they may become antisocial and have no friends.

Getting regular physical activity in a friendly surrounding also helps people who might have had a troubled past.

When others around to support one and other it also brings up the moods of possibly depressed people.

6699DEA066F3,Conclusion.Student communication with the teacher becomes easier when the student is in a classroom rather than in an online class. ,0,2,21
6699DEA066F3,"Conclusion.In a physical classroom, the teacher is usually present and is easily accessible, but in an online class, the teacher is not always there when a student needs them; the student would have to rely on sending an email or sending a message through a school-sponsored online chat and wait for a response. The waiting time can range from seconds to hours, or perhaps, days, depending on the teacher's schedule. For example, in the summer, a student may take an online class for economics and personal finance. There would be a time where the student would need to ask a proctor a question about the testing rules, so in that situation, he would email and wait for a response before the test date. However, the student received an email regarding testing rules after the test date. In situations like this, there is uncertainty in determining when the proctor will respond since the student does not know exactly when the proctor is online; but, in a classroom, this scenario would not happen. Because the student is face to face with the teacher, he gets an immediate response. This makes the situation much easier and stress free for the student. 
",3,2,199
6699DEA066F3,"Conclusion.Online, the student is limited to a screen with lesson materials on it. Also, schools and teachers are limited to adding documents, websites, and tests online. Because of these limits, the online experience feels dull and straightforward with tests and documents. In a physical classroom, there are lectures, models, posters, and hands-on activities available to the student. These physical resources can help a student remember class materials better through the unique experience they would go through. Unlike the online learning experience, a physical learning experience is flexible and fun to the student. A computer will fail to produce these resources to the students because of its limited functionality from technology. ",3,2,111
6699DEA066F3,"Concluding Statement.
Classroom taught classes are more beneficial to students rather than online classes because of the social skills students attain, the simple communication the students have with teachers, and the memorable physical experience the students gain. These significant differences in physcial classrooms and online classrooms should be taken into consideration by many schools when deciding whether or not they should offer online classes. Technology should not be overused by schools in the age of modern technology; otherwise, modern students will lose the social skills and educational benefits a classroom would have brought. Classroom-based classes will benefit the future of students. ",1,2,101

The Electoral College has about 538 electors a majority of 270 are electoral votes is required to elect the President by which your state entitled allotment of electors equals the numer of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators.

Not only is adapting a problem but is our technology advanced enough to have driverless cars? We as a society are advanced in the technology area but is it advanced enough to develop cars that are able to know where to go or what to do just like humans are?

678A6C5DE012,"Conclusion.Since there is a winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning.

GM has developed drivers seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over.

6A91EB21FE91,"Conclusion.Cars were ment to be many things, comfortable, muscle, work, luxury, cheap, and fun for a lot of people.

If a whole car was a computer, what would you do, sit there and eat? you wouldnt be paying attention, you'd be all relaxed, and probably sleeping if you were tired. There are many things that i can say are bad for being in a car that is a computer with a frame, an engine, exhaust manifold, and many more parts. ",4,0,100

6C30C0076FAD,"Conclusion.Independence is a trait that empowers all those who possess it as it enables them to function on their own. Between fixed bell schedules and assigned bathroom breaks and a plethora of functional rigidity, independence is rather unfortunately not a trait that is bred well in traditional American schools. However, as students grow to become adults with much more autonomy than is allowed in said schools, this dependency can become malignant to the development of their own psyches. Giving students the ability to attend a distance learning program is something that can, in turn, teach students to become more independent and self-reliant. Between managing their own time, finishing their coursework, and learning to use their online resources wisely, students will gain a learning curve which will lead them to be vastly more independent than they would have been in a traditional school setting. Take, for example, students who complete online courses via the Generic_School program in the Generic_City school district. In the form to apply for courses, students are asked how they demonstrate independence and ability to manage their coursework. As distance learning demands more in terms of organization than traditional schooling does, it is clearly vital for students to be, or at least to learn to be, more independent. ",3,2,211
6C30C0076FAD,"Concluding Statement.In summation, schools should implement distance learning as it serves as a vital benefit to students who genuinely cannot gain from traditional forms of education. By allowing for flexible schedules, distance learning provides a feasible alternative to students who cannot perform their tasks within the confines of traditional schools. By encouraging independence, distance learning empowers students to learn discipline and organization in addition to traditional academia. Knowledge is indeed power, and with the knowledge that educators have about distance learning, they must now enable students to experience first hand how distance learning can benefit them. ",1,2,97
6C3E863C67FC,"Conclusion.As we should know, ""the Electoral College is a process not an actual place. It serves as a compromise of the presidential election in Congress and by popular vote"" (paragraph 1). It can be good at times but most times it has its downfalls. ",4,0,45

6C3E863C67FC,"Concluding Statement.All in all, the Electoral college has both its good things and their downfalls. As can be seen the bad out ways the good in this situation. A voters vote isn't necessarily direct because they aren't voting on a single representative, they are voting on a group of individuals in which they believe will vote for the candidate in which they choose. Also, being that the number of electors is based on a state's number of congressional represenatives it is an unequal and unfair number of electors per state. The electoral college can even cause an uproar if a tie ever falls in place because the ""tie breaker"" is left in the hands of the House of Representatives. Basically ""the electoral colleg is unfair, and irrational"" (paragraph 14) and it should be abolished because there is a great amount of mix ups and failures within the system itself.   ",1,2,150

7263826C2217,"Conclusion.Most people are too busy, or lazy, or just dont want to take part in voting becuse of all of the conficting ads placed on television. One of the most atrocious of these ads was the one from mitt romney when he was in the race against President Obama. They put these ads on a chanel designated for familys to veiw, along with children. These ads inculded vivid pictures of aborted fetus, saying this is what would happen if we voted for obama. I've only saw that ad once, but once was more than enough to make me side with Obama more than I already was. If our president is prepared to threten the country like that then they should not be eligable to even run, let alone become President, and it was horendus to think of all of the children watching at the time to have to see that. Most Americans who are eligable to vote have full-time jobs, full-time school, or are busy in some other aspects of life. These people do not have the time to vote for our president becuase they are working at the time, most work one or two jobs at the least, leaving little time for social graces and time alone, let alone time to vote. One other reason citizens dont vote is just hte sheer fact that they are lazy. A good precetage of Americans just do not care about who our president is or who runs for office, thus not voting out of sheer laziness. ",3,1,255

73B7AA4CFB1C,"Concluding Statement.As a current student in middle school, I have learned how children use cell phones. If you are reconsidering the cell phone policy, I believe the second one is the only way to go. Children in this school may sneak their cell phones into class without the teacher ever knowing if they are not banned. This will also lead to students doing poorly in class because they won't be paying attention to the teacher. Also, the use of cell phones in a wrong way can cause a student to get hurt.

754CED955EFD,"Conclusion.Richard A. Posner reason 1:

Certainty Of  Outcome

Dispute over  the out come is possible-it happend in 2000- but its less likely than a dispute between popular vote. the reson is that winnning candidate's share of electoral collage invariably exeeds his share of the popular vote.

reason 2

:

Everyone's President

The electoral college  requirs canadates to have trans-regional appeal. no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional such as Mitt Romneywas in the south,has so innocently favored for he gain electoral vote by increasing his plurality in those states and if done he know he'll win.

reason 3

:

Swing States

The winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes induces  the canidates-as we saw in [2012's] election- to focus their campaign efforts on the toss up states. Voters in toss up states are more likeley to pay close attention to the campeign to really listen to the competeing canidates knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likeley to be on the most thoughtful votes, on average(and futher reason they will have recived the most information and attention from the canidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the one to decide the election.

reason 4

:

Big States

The electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states have (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionmentof the senate decreed in the constitution. The popular vote was very close in Florida [2012] never the less obama, who won that vote got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in woyming would net the winner got 3 electoral votes.

reason 5

:

Avoid Run-Off Elections

The electoral college avoids run-off elections wich no canindate recives a majority of the votes cast. For example , Nixion in 1968 and Clinton both had only 43% plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral college. There is pressure for run-off elections when no canidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure,wichwould greatly complicate the presidential election processes.

All that matters is the way you comprehend work and what kind of a space you work best in.

You turn on the television and your local news station reports that your school is closed today, so rather than spending a wasteful snow day doing nothing and having to make up seat time later in the year, you log onto your computer and connect with your teachers and classmates via video chat. In many schools in the United States, this situation is quite common. As technology becomes readily available to more and more people, some schools offer the option for students to learn without being at school by way of the Internet.

7C8094BF63DE,Conclusion.There are many elements that play into the reasoning for this. The Electoral College is a process developed by the makers of the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. It consists of 538 electors with each state holding a certain amout of these electors based on the population of that state. Candidates try to gain the vote of electors focusing on larger states with more electors ,3,0,87
7C8094BF63DE,"Conclusion.Presidential candidates focus on gaining the majority vote of large states in order to obtain more electors. A large state such as California containing over 35 million voters should have as much of a say in electing a president as a small state like Wyoming only containing 500,000 voters. The Electoral College makes sure that the ""majority"" of voters doesn't decide an election and everyone has a say. The ""winner takes all"" system evens out the playing field for all those little states who want just as much of a say in determining a new president as a large one does. ",3,0,103
7C8094BF63DE,Conclusion.Voters should be able to vote not just for a new president but for a slate of electors who aid in electing the president.. These electors are appointed to represent the people in choosing the candidate of their choice who they feel is best suited for the position. ,3,0,49

You see only one state can casts only one vote in Wyoming,representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California,who represent 35 million voters. In 1968,a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election;in 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters on Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. ",3,0,111

They would be voting for the canidate and these many people that have pledged themselves to him and they don't even know it.

This also makes the student more relived that he or she can listen to music. Students who are always trying to bust a joke or make a noise causes problems for a student who is trying to work to get her grade up this makes it very hard for a student to focus on what their are supposed to do.

89039D21E960,"Conclusion.As stated in the third article, paragraph 19, ""...because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" Also in the paragraph, it states that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. If the president was decided by popular vote, however, can you imagine what it would be like? Take Romney, for example. He was a solid regional favorite in the South. Romney knew that there was no incentive to campaign heavily in the South, because he would not gain any electoral votes by increasing his plurilaty in states he knew he would win. If popularity decided the president, residents of the other regions might feel like their vote would not count, and that the president would have no regard for their interests. Say that popularity did actually determine a winner. While most regions might vote for a certain presidents, the ones that did not would feel like that the man running the country wasnt really ""their president"". However, Mr. Senator, if the Electoral College was to stay, this problem would never exist. With the system we have now, the people vote for your state's electors when they vote for the president. Most states also have a ""winner-take-all"" system. Therefore, the canidate with the most votes in a state win's that state's electors. This lets the voting be even, fair. A popular vote would make the voting unfair to those who did not want that president. ",3,2,246
89039D21E960,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion, Mr. State Senator, I think that keeping the Electoral College is the best thing for our country. If we changed to election by popular vote, the man (or woman) might not be the best for our country, and the best man might not win because he is not a regional favorite. I hope, sir, that you will take my letter into account when you go to vote on this topic.            ",1,2,74

89AB334EE7ED,Conclusion.Community service teaches the youth of the importance of having a strong community. ,0,0,14
89C55AA2CA12,"Conclusion.if they play sports, they are doing community service. Also if they help someone out they are doing community service. Finally the students are doing community service just by showing up to school. That is just one more reason why the students shouldn't have to do community service. ",3,0,49
89CE2C3E8E32,"Conclusion.They keep with the speed limit adamatically, stop at aproprited time and also slow down when is needed. Adomatic cars will reduce the amount of accidents we have on the road by a lot. Accident are moslty caused by a driver, with adomatic cars, they will stop quicker than a person has time to react. But this plan will only work if everyone gets a smart car. Say if three out of four people get a smart car there will still be some normal cars left on the road, which with those cars an aciddent can be made. Self driving cars can avoid all the natural accident such as an animal running in the road or bad weather conditons. In addition to that many driver become sleepy or distracted when it come to driving, when self driving car are machines that will not do that. ",3,0,146
89CE2C3E8E32,Conclusion.Self driving cars are going to be the safest option on the roads today ,5,0,15
89FCD2B81990,"Conclusion.Finally, because the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus on obtaining votes instead informing all voters about their intentions, only the influential ""swing"" states receive enough attention from candidates to make a well-informed decision when voting. ",0,0,37
89FCD2B81990,"Conclusion.Under the Electoral College, voters do not vote directly for who they want as president, but instead for a slate of electors, who in turn select the president. Although these electors may pledge themselves to a particular candidate, there is no way to determine whether or not they end up casting their vote according to the will of the people who put them in charge. Such an unpredictable turn of events could be avoided if only the outcomes of presidential elections were determined by popular vote, not through an Electoral College. ",3,2,92
8A60E09A7062,"Conclusion.Since this car still needs a driver this car can alert you that you need to take the wheel at any given time. Therefore, if you buy this car be very alert. ",3,0,33
8A63149E402C,"Conclusion.it would be easier to become distracted during schoolwork. 
",0,2,10
8A63149E402C,Conclusion.For example In my ninth grade biology class we had to dissect a frog and organize it's organs. During the assignment I learned more about that frog than I could anywhere else because of the hands on nature of the assignment. This just goes to show that if we started using distance learning courses they would miss out on the hands on portion of learning. ,3,2,66
8A63149E402C,"Concluding Statement.
Distance learning in theory is a great idea because of how convenient it is, but the main reason why distance learning would not benefit students is because of how convenient it is. So to sum up schools should stay the way they are and not offer any distance courses because of how it would change what we are able to learn. ",1,0,63
8A8F6BCA1D23,"Conclusion.Under the 23 Amendment of the constitution, the district of columbia is allocated three electors and treated like a state for pupose of the Electoral college ",3,1,27
8B095EB24288,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion online courses have many great opportunities and good advantage for students, and some of the reasons are: because some students have to work, they have family, and others live to far away ",1,0,36
8B24D2970F52,Conclusion.will be just like forcing students to work using physical means to receive a good grade. ,0,0,17
8B24D2970F52,"Concluding Statement.Is that enough for you? Is that enough to make you postpone or abort this decision? Well if you want to have rebels around the school you obviously do not. hey, or maybe if you want to accomplish the opposite of your original goal ,do it. If you want to be the principle who accepted this offer to make us do unfair activities, well then go right ahead. I think i have proven my point in bold fashion, do you disagree? ",1,0,83
8B4BBB3F601D,"Conclusion.I truly have no opinion on the electoral college and whether or not to keep it, but as this topic insists I must write my own opinion to you and here is what I think. Even with this article sort of informing me on this topic I still seem to have a misunderstanding (or no understanding) of what the Electoral College really is or what it does. Perhaps this is because of the lack of information I'm given about our government, or perhaps its because what the electoral college does is quite irrelevant to me and my fellow peers. ",4,1,100
8B4BBB3F601D,"Conclusion.From what I have gathered though, the electoral college is a group of people that citizens vote for and these people are then allowed to elect a president? I am sure there is a lot more to it but from that statement which is proven true by the article, ",3,0,50
8B4BBB3F601D,Conclusion.By having the electoral college it's like the government is lying to us. ,0,0,14
8B64BA63E623,"Conclusion.
A lot of chatter about weather the president should be elected by electoral college or by popular vote is going around my school for the past couple of weeks, and i can't help but to give my own opinion about this argument. ",4,0,43
8B64BA63E623,"Conclusion.Some may believe otherwise. For example, since the Electoral votes are from very experienced people that have put there life and time into knowing about what is right and wrong. they are much more experience than the normal citizens ",2,0,40
8B7A871FC14B,Conclusion.Why do the state of senator wish to take away electoral college votes? because they think there is to much voting bc under the electoral college system voters vote not just for the president but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president. ,0,0,47
8B7A871FC14B,Conclusion.But the outcome of all this is that electoral college vite is possible an its less likely to dispute over the popular vote. A electoral vote is possible because the total number of vites is 538 is an even number. ,3,0,41
8B7A871FC14B,Concluding Statement.So to rap it all up it can be argued that the electoral collge method of selecting the president may turn off pontenial voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying for their state. voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election ,1,1,64
8BA0BFC49C4F,Conclusion.The policy I think you should put in affect is the first policy that allows students to have their cell phones in school but it cannot be present or used during class times. ,5,0,34
8BA0BFC49C4F,Conclusion.One reason why she shouldn't pick the second policy the one that says no phones at all is because of safety. ,0,0,22
8BA0BFC49C4F,Conclusion.What if one doesn't take the school bus and left their t-bus money home how are they going to reach their parents and tell them they have no money? Little situations like this can happen everyday and this may cause frustration among parents and guardians. ,3,0,46
8BA0BFC49C4F,"Conclusion.Take it from a student, most rules are broken so I really doubt students aren't going to stop bringing their phones to school for example in our school gum isn't allowed but students continue to bring gum and chew it in school the rules and the detention doesn't stop them. ",2,0,51
8BA0BFC49C4F,Conclusion.But if you make something reasonable and fair maybe the usage of phone doing school hours will stop. ,6,0,19
8BCA72A4D66C,"Conclusion.Next, even presidents, AFL-CIO in their time have aggreed with this. they all want to remove the electoral college. ",0,2,20
8BD74B7B3DE2,"Conclusion.If a student is sick they dont have to miss any class work and have their grade effected, ",0,2,19
8BD74B7B3DE2,"Conclusion.In October Generic_Name missed two weeks of school because he had the flu and couldnt leave his bed but if he would have had online classes he could just have done them from home and not have had his grades impacted so severely. Like many others Generic_Name had become sick and had to miss school and many assignments if he would have been able to do his classes online There would have been little to no impact. If more schools would pick up online schooling there would not be incidents like this anymore. Generic_Name recently got back from a trip to France with his family and unfortunately was infected with COVID-19 ( Coronavirus) and now he will have to miss an extended period of school and be quarantined meaning he cant receive an education, But if he could do his work online he would be able to continue to receive an education while quarantined. This being a much more serious scenario of missing school that as of right now schools should start to take into consideration, none the less having online school would solve one of the problems this child is facing. Both of these students could have their grades remain intact if there was online schooling. In conclusion there would be no more need for sick days if when a student is sick they can just work from home. ",3,2,231
8BE2FA4CDD8F,Conclusion.Because of the winer takes all system in each state it's unfair to the voters and it's unfair to me so changing the election by popular votes for the president of the united states would be best. ,5,2,38
8BE2FA4CDD8F,"Conclusion.the Electroal College consists of 538 electorals. Say the article only 270 eletroals are required to elect the president. In the article the system allows for much worse, but wrose as the election crisis in a century? Well i think so! ",3,1,42
8BE2FA4CDD8F,"Concluding Statement.It's all happening, everything i said in the begining...about the trouble. Why the senate gets to choose the vice president? why cant the qualified citizens choose for there selfs. That whole area needs some enjustments before they start chooseing for people. ",1,0,44

8C5FF7AD4E99,Conclusion.The reason why students should be required to perform community service is that it helps out the environment. ,0,0,19
8C5FF7AD4E99,Conclusion.There are many ways to perform community service. ,0,1,9
8C62721A56E0,"Conclusion.. . . their difficulties are that ""Under the Electoral college system,voters vote not for the President,but for a slate of electors,who in turn elect the president. If you lived in texas,for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of thirty four Democratic electors pledge to Kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and Kerry would get thirty four electoral votes. Who are the Electors? They can be anyone not holding public ofice."" so that is pretty bad but yet choosing you own President would'nt be okey neither because it would be harder and no one can give Presidents the ideas and the presidents would have to come up with the ideas alone. 
",3,1,131

8D0E03A58CC9,"Conclusion.Though some places dont support online classes, there always other places to try out at that may offer similar classes to those you want to attend online, and they might have better benefits than those at a different school. ",3,1,40
8D0E03A58CC9,"Conclusion.Online classes can also cut down on the cost of materials needed for the class you wanna take online. Though they may seem not worth it, a online class can cut the cost of a class by a lot, and this in turn helps the student pay for required materials he may need for the class to attend it. ",3,0,60
8D0E03A58CC9,Conclusion.Scientific research shows that this feeling can lower a students work effort by almost 100 percent. That is why you must always ask if a class flexible enough for you to take without feeling confined. ,3,0,36
8D242A52F9B3,"Conclusion.
Joe and I have different belifes, although I agree with him on this one. Only because, there are already Martin Messas around Cyndonia. But there aren't any like this thats has ever been seen before. I also think that all theses UNmasking face on mars are created by aliens or martins only because, the name Martin Messa.

8D47E7F9968F,Conclusion.if were walking home and its after school and we get hurt ,3,0,13
8D47E7F9968F,Conclusion.I believe that we should only get in trouble when using our cell-phones is when we are using it during class. But besides that we shouldn't be getting in trouble just by using it during lunch. ,3,1,37
8D5DC914F9F3,"Conclusion.Imagine you're going down 267 here in Plainfield. You're in a driverless car and the car begins to accelerate, however it doesnt meet a constant speed. As the car continues to go faster and faster, its to late to stop because you already rearended the car infront of you. Causing the person in the car infront of you to spin out of controll and hit a telephone pole. Because of a computer error in the car an inicent bystander's life has been taken. That there just shows the potental danger the driverless car has just due to the ""auto acceleration"" programing in the car. ",3,0,105

8D5DC914F9F3,Conclusion.Using the heads-up system could get the attention of the driver to let them know that they need to take over. What happens when the driver doesnt take over and the car continues to have a mind of it's own. Again possiable resulting in an accident and a possiable faitality. ,3,0,51
8D69369DEDA2,"Conclusion.Obviously the president who has apppeared more times on television or at meetings will win. This method screams unfairness. Whichever candidate has more money and funding will obviously become more popular, even if their intentions as president arent as good as the qualities the other candidate's are. ",3,1,48
8D7CBF2251F1,"Conclusion.The electoral college  has been used for many years. Most people think that it is a place and not a process , well it is a process. the electoral college is the selection of electors. for the process they need 538 electors, for 270 electoral votes. Each canidate has their own group. The presidential election is held every  four years to elect or keep the same president for 4 years. ",4,0,70
8D7CBF2251F1,"Conclusion.i say that if the outcome isnt fair then how are u supposse to win as a president. Having more votes as a canidate is not fair but thats how you win by having more votes.

My opinion on that is why would losing be fair thats the point one canidate wins and one loses. of couse the other person who lost would have anger and therefore be upset and say that the electoral is an unfair jugdement. ",6,0,79
8D9D207D883C,"Conclusion.Like one is the winnner-take-all sytyem, by a couple of votes off and one canidate takes all the points in that state. So with that, canidates will use mostly of he's/her's attention on big states to get all the big points there. And little states see little to no campaign ads for any candidates because of the electoral college. ",3,0,60

8F899DE6880E,Conclusion.the people. ,0,2,3
8F899DE6880E,"Conclusion.For example, The Electoral College system serves as ""checks-and-balances."" In the words of the Office of the Federal Register in ""What Is the Electoral College?"": ""The founding fathers established [The Electoral College] as a compromise between Congress and election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens,"" (Office of the Federal Register 1). This system of voting balances the voice of the people with the voice of Congress. ",3,0,84
8F899DE6880E,"Conclusion.The Office of the Federal Register writes that ""most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate,"" (Office of the Federal Register 7). This means that the popular vote does determine - for most states anyway - whether or not the candidate recieves all of the electoral votes for that particular state. ",3,0,60
8F899DE6880E,"Conclusion.However, Richard A. Posner makes a fair point: ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. ",6,2,20
8F899DE6880E,"Conclusion.No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president...[If a candidate with only regional appeal becomes President] the residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised - to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president,"" (Posner 19).

900A879708F0,Conclusion.requiring students to spend long hours comprehending difficult material can become increasingly straining and taxing on both the mind and body. ,0,2,22
900A879708F0,Conclusion.Another reason online classes are not as beneficial as they may appear is that students face constant distraction and opportunity to cheat at home than if they were in the classroom. ,0,2,32
900A879708F0,"Conclusion.It's easy to think there would actually be less distraction in the quiet of your own home than classrooms that can sometimes be full of loud and troublesome students, subsequently making it hard to focus at times. ",2,2,38
900A879708F0,"Conclusion.Although this isn't accurate for online classes done in conjunction with the school year, the summer geometry class I took often resulted in me working on the computer for upwards of eight hours everyday.

916117BFE2A1,"Concluding Statement.Electing a president is very important to the country. Electing the president that people think could help support the U.S is also very important but very difficult as well. People should be able to easily vote for their prefered president with no difficulty, which happens to be caused by the Electoral College. By aborting this process, voters could control who they vote for and have a say in their country by voting for their prefered president. Having citizens tricked into voting for an elector is not the way to elect a president. Should'nt people in the Unites States have a say in who their president should be without being tricked?                         ",1,2,113
9165D265E932,"Conclusion.Everyone loves the idea of being able to stay home and complete all of their work from home. Sounds good right? Well it might not be as good as you think it would. Being home schooled, as some would call it, is not as beneficial as someone would think. Yes, the idea of having to wake up in the morning and go to school is hard for most people, but in reality going to an actual physical school can help you in many ways. Some people argue that even though this might be true it's still better for kids to do their work at home. ",4,2,106

9165D265E932,"Conclusion.In every single class offered at school, from math to art, each class is able to teach their students something valuable that will help them succeed in the future. For example, it's very important that everyone no matter their age has good communication skills and is able to work well with others. If kids don't attend school then how are they going to be able to strengthen these important skills if they're at home. It's very important for someone to have these skills in order for them to function in the real world. Imagine getting a part time job at your favorite cafe and then getting fired because you can't communicate well and work with your fellow employees. That would be horrible and could potentially happen again because of the lack of basic skills. By going to school we can assure that kids learn these skills and will be able to do well on: job interviews, be able to communicate with others, and work well with anyone they meet. Time goes by fast and sooner than later kids will grow up and venture out into the real world we must make sure they are ready; and this can only be done if they attend school regularly. ",3,2,207

924D8175D100,"Conclusion.Many students with illnesses such as Lyme disease are forced to skip class due to their illness. If too many days are missed, the student can fall behind in class and many be forced to repeat a class or an entire year. This causes an unneeded burden on the student, the family, and the school system. The aforesaid parties would greatly benefit from a remote learning system as the chronically ill student would be able to keep pace with the class from home. This reduces the probability that the student fails the class and is forced to repeat it. By making lectures available online, these students, and all students for that matter, would be given the chance to earn a higher grade as working outside of the class is more efficient. Students who want to study for an exam can go back through old lectures to ensure that they know all of the important information presented in class. This would result in higher grades, fewer failing students, and a better chance of success in college and later in life. ",3,2,180

It has the potential to allow the electors to defy the will of the people who voted them in, invalidating the people's votes and making them pointless. It also has candates only focusing their ads and visits on the states with more votes and the states biased towards their party. Finally, it has almost all the states have a landslide ""winner-takes_all"" style of awarding electorial votes. This means if one side of electors only wins by a slim margin, the other side gets nothing, even though since they lost by a small number they clearly have a sizeable amount of voters for them.

96B8F7A4DAB9,"Conclusion.The reason students text during class is because the class isn't interesting enough.

I hope you take this information to good use and use it to tear down this unfair system once and for all. If we really want to be a democracy, than we have to do away with this system. Many of Americans believe that this is the best way and several have published interesting papers on that topic that may chaneg the minds of people who are still for it.

The other reason is that they play in a sport or stay after school but the coach or the person that stay after school had a to do something and left early . My other reason could be that the person forgot to bring a book for a class and they need it. The other reason is that the person does not have money and they need money to buy something they need , or they need money to get in train .

Free time gives these students a chance to be involved in the community more through different things such as volunteering, having a job, working for an internship, and so much more. For example, one online student I know likes to volunteer at the animal shelter when she can because she wants to become a veterinarian. Her free time allows for her to learn more information and develop the skills for what she wants in the future. It sets kids up for success rather than failure by allowing them to find interests in high school rather than switching subjects every year in college. This free time lets them create a more lasting impact on their community while also finding out more about the real world and what it hold for students when they graduate. ",3,2,159

9C1132980450,"Conclusion.Television and movies have developed a theory of these cars. The theory is how the car may look and also, drive. Google has had cars that could drive independently under certain circumstances since 2009. Google cars have driven over half a million miles without a crash. google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and a inertial motion sensor.

Companies are already, and have already, been making these computer driven cars. As an example, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track. The track was embedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car. Google made the modified Toyota Prius, and BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020.

These, ""driverless"" cars are not really driverless. Antilock brakes and driver assistance still seem a long way from the dream of calling a driverless carb to take us wherever we desire, but Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google Car project, believes that the technology has finally begun to catch up to the dream. The Google Cars must have an alert driver when driving. The Google Car cannot pull in and out of driveways. When dealing with road contrustion or navigating through an accident, the driver must take over then as well. The BMW, ""Traffic Jam Assistant,"" can reach speeds up to 25 miles per hour, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills.

In other words people think they don't have a voice in the election because their vote really doesn't matter the vote that really matters is the Eletroral vote. Due to this reason less and less people vote these days. About i half of eligible voters voted in 2012's election as you can see there is a drop in voters.

9FE339BCFE2C,"Conclusion.Although you may think you are voting for your choice of president, you are not.  As of now, when you cast your vote, you are actually just voting for your candidate's electors, as said in ""What Is the Electoral College"".  In the 2000 campaign, voters in seventeen states didn't have a chance to see the candidates at all.  Those candidates went mainly to the ""swing"" states, or states that were not certain on who they would be voting for.  The states unvisited, such as Rhode Island and South Carolina, were passed over because the candidates knew they would or wouldn't have their vote no matter what.  The ones who questioned their vote did not have the chance to see either candidate in their state.  In, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"", the Romney and Obama election is mentioned.  It brings up the fact that Romney knew that throughout the South, he was going to get their vote.  He realized that there was no need to go there because he didn't need anymore popularity in the South because he had already gained their electoral votes.  Those who opposed Romney in the southern states felt that their votes would not matter because majority already knew they were voting for Romney.  If the system were to change, which I believe it should, more people would feel their votes mattered no matter what state they were in. ",3,2,245
9FE339BCFE2C,"Conclusion.The slate of electors is not picked by the people.  It is said in, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid jdefenses of the system are wrong"", that sometimes the state conventions, the party's central committee, or the presidential candidates themselves choose who will be their electors.  That being said, you don't know whether or not the electors will follow your choice of president or not.  For example, in 1960, some electors refused to vote for their party's candidate and they chose whomever they wanted. If we were to switch the way things are now, that would not happen.  A poll taken in 2000 called the Gallup poll, showed that over 60% of voters prefered a direct election rather then the kind we have now.  This took place when Al Gore recieved the popular vote, but lost the electoral votes.  You can see that the current system has its flaws.

There are many kids who have a C average and that is a perfectly good passing grade. What would be the actual point to doing this anyway? School is hard enough for it is the twenty first century, and making it even harder and more stressful would be bad. To sum it all up, making kids with C average grades not able to play sports is a terrible idea.

A2A80E683990,"Conclusion.In 2009,Google had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions. their cars have drieven more than half a million miles without crashing, but these cars aren't exactly completely driverless. For example, if you were to buy a driverless car you'd stil have to stay alert, like any other non-driverless car, but you'd be able to take your eyes off the road for about 30 seconds. If you'll have to pay attention to the car as its driving, you'd have better luck just driving it yourself. if theres an accident, traffic issues,or roadwork, you'll end up being the one who has to drive for who knows how long ",3,0,111
A2A80E683990,"Conclusion.People have been fascinated with driverless cars since the late 1950's. For example, in the late 1950's, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a soecial track. this track had been embedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car. Engineer at Berkeley tried the same thing but this time they used magnetics with alternating polarity. The car would read positive and negative polarity messages in Binary code. The ""smart-road"" systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to the existing roads, but they were way to expensive.

In the 1980's automakers would use speed sensors at the wheel in the creation of antilock breaks. Within 10 years, these sensors had become more advanced to detect and resopnd to danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. the information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine. this alowed better response and control than any human could manage alone.

Sebastian Thrun, founder of the google car project, believes that the technology has finally began to catch up to the dreams. Before the 2000's, they didn't have all the sensors, the computers, or the mapping. the Radar was a device that cost two hundred thousand milion dollars. 
",3,1,220
A2A80E683990,"Conclusion.In 2013, BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" This car could handle driving speeds up to 25 mph. This car had special touch sensors to make sure thatthe driver keeps their hands on the wheel. The cars could steer,accelerate, and brake themselves, but if there were any traffic incidents, the car would require human skills. This means that the driver would have to stay alert as if they were driving. To keep the driver alert, GM has developed seats that vibrate the driver's seat when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The google the car announces when the driver should be prepared to take over the wheel. Also, other options for the cars driver to stay alert is flashing on the windshield and on the heads up displays. Manufacturing is also considering cameras to watch the driver or make sure that they are remaining focused on the road ",3,0,157

A34F66AA1F99,Concluding Statement.I believe that we shouldn't change the Electoral College for popular votes the way we arevoting now is working just fine and it makes it so larger states like Texas don't get more of an impact on the election because of thier population than smaller states like Rhode Island. Also the Electoral College prevents Run-off elections. Even though some believe the Electoral College as an anachronism I think that the Electoral College is still a good way of voting. ,1,2,81

A3D4D71B62F4,"Conclusion.Recently it has come to my attention that there is some controversy over the potential community service requirement. Some students believe that community service is important and are very passionate about the work they are doing. However, other students think that community service will take away too much time from other things they participate in, which are of greater value to them. As you can see, both sides have valid points to make. ",4,2,74
A3D4D71B62F4,"Conclusion.First, this solution addresses the wants of the first group. ",0,2,11
A3D4D71B62F4,"Conclusion.. If the kids that think community service will interfere with their schedule have A averages, then they will not need to do the community service. However, if their grades fall below that mark, they will need to participate. This ensures that the kids who do not do the community service are spending enough of their time on schoolwork. As the principal, motivating kids to achieve higher in school should appeal to you. ",3,2,73

A42D860C93B0,"Conclusion.If this great country of ours is a democracy, shouldnt be the president decided by the people for the people. ",5,0,21
A47BE7BB6F08,"Conclusion.This reason is because of their winner takes all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in the states they feel they have no chance of winning. They only focus on the

""swing"" states , the states they feel they have a chance in or feel they have to win over. During the 2000 campaign , seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all and the largest media didn't get to see a single  campaign ad.

A4C9096A123B,Conclusion.Another reason I think citizens should be able to choose who they want to be president is because. Its not fair to people cause that would be like a citizens vote doesnt even count and the government doesnt really care about what citizens think and they dont care about how we feel. ,0,1,53
A500CCF711B0,"Conclusion.If no one volunteered to do anything than the school would look bad, the community to, and no one would be a better person.

A57F5B6E1247,Conclusion.The counterclaim for my argument may suggest that the certainty of outcome and the expulsion of run-off elections is enough to substantiate the electoral college. ,2,2,26
A57F5B6E1247,"Conclusion.Source 3, ""In Defense to the Electoral College"", even admits that the electoral college is a non-democratic method of selecting a president (lines 15-17). Liars, we are liars then. Americans project an image of America to the world that we are a peacful democracy. However, if the way that we select our leaders isn't even democratic, why are we portraying this false mirage. The electoral college is an anachronism (lines 15- 16). We are a stage four country on the demographic treansitions model. Therefore, our aspirations should be looking forward and not rooted in the past. ",3,2,97
A57F5B6E1247,Conclusion.The electoral college system is a mock of the American people and an outdated idea that does not fit in with our current state as a whole. ,5,2,28

A9105216AAA3,"Conclusion.The reliance of a driver within the driverless car finalizes the development of the driverless car. If the car encounters a foreign situation, the driver will just be notified and will take over from there. This concept of passing over the responsibility of driving makes the driverless car very safe. As long as there is an alert driver within the car, the car is almost certainly not going to make any accidents. Car developers designed the driverless car to ""steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" Thus, the car will do most of the driving and when there is a difficult situation, the human driver will take over. This ensure the utmost safety of the driver and the passengers as there is an extremely low risk of an accident occuring. There are ""driver's seats that vibrate"" and the Google car even ""announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."" This increases the safety of the driverless car as the driver will be notified when to take over. Therefore, the driver will also know the situation and will be ready to handle any troubles the driverless car couldn't handle. The safety features positively affect the development of the driverless car. ",3,2,215

AA0FF7AA95C3,"Conclusion.The candidates running for the presidency only visit the largly populated states in order to get their electoral points, for instance, most candidates go to Californa or Texas becuase those are the states that have for electoral points. But, by doing this all the smaller states that have less electoral points are never visited by the candidates, the voters then may have never seen an ad or campiagn for a certain candidates . According to Source 2: ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"", by Bradford Plummer, it states, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and votes in 25 of the media markets didn't get to see a single campiagn ad"". On the contrary, it is stated by Source 3: In defense of the Electoral College, it states,"" No reigon has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" This is true, but candiadtes focus on larger states that will supply them with more electoral votes, and don't even visit or pay any attention the smaller states. I strongly negate the Electoral College. ",3,2,194

AABDFA8D20B1,Conclusion.Driving without driveless cars was a joy and something people love to do but with driveless cars it ruins the experinece as you do not get to control the car anymore and just have to watch it drive itself. This has been a big problem for car companies as they have to get people to buy their car and enjoy the ride and the car and companies do not know how to do that. Werner Huber who is the BMW project manger said that with cars being able to drive by themselves they have to find new ways to attract and make the costumers enjoy the car and they can not find a way to do that without putting the driver adn the passengers at risk. The only things they have founded to make the car enjoyable to drive with driveless cars is entrainment systems or texting but all these may be enjoyable to the driver but also puts the driver at risk. ,3,2,164

The president is to serve the people of his country well with responisbilities that can vary to meet the needs of the country,but the electoral college seems to become more and more unfair to those who vote. ",4,2,94
AD005493F9BF,"Conclusion.In the article

What Is The Electoral College by the office of the Federal Register, it states that the election process is held every four years along with the after election prepared by the govenor titled ""Certificate Of Ascertainment"" which sums the canadidates and electors as well as the winning canadidate. It is obvious that the voters only know so much of what they vote for and do not really get a good taste of how the presidential canadidate is like. It can be clear that as a blind election, the voters have no hints of who they might be voting towards and in the end can cause a major catasrophe if a canadidate has very little intentions for the states. In agreement to the article the text

In the defense of the electoral college by Richard A. Posner it begins to sate the election of Romney who, by increasing his plurality and possesing only regional appeal, lost the peoples desire to vote for him thinking that the man has no regards for their interest and does not have any intentions of improving their needs or helping with creating a community where the people can rely on Romney. The actions taken began to change the thoughts of the citizens and create a petrifying conclusion that the man was not on the run to be everyone's president. This dilema could have been changed around if Romney had shown that he had cared more for his state and his country and thought more about the needs he could fill and the actions he could improve, then many of the voters would have most likely shown repsect and a desire for the man to be choosen as their new president. On the opposing hand Romney had not shown any of those qualities or passion which had caused for him to be thought of as unresponisble and selfish.

The country has more than thousands and thousands of people to serve and direct. It can be understood that having a large amount of citizens can result in uncertainty towards the election and the votes cast, yet it is yet to be changed to a more reasonable way of confronting it. With many systems such as ""Winner-Take -All"" due to states titled as the ""Swing States,"" it can be an untrustworthy election fo rmany voters around the country. The election process not only need to be changed to select a more responsible canadidate, but to create a more trustworthy system of itself.

AD1914496798,"Conclusion.In an election their really is a process of voting and voting again. Instead of couting the number of people who want a certain president and so on. We are viewed as a state and some states having more say than other even if the votes are in the same margin. This is the reason why some states are focused on more by the candidates and are heavily educated on the topic and given more attention than smaller states whose votes wont change much. an even bigger problem is te fact that most states operate on a winner-take-all basis so even a slight majority vote one way will give that person all of the votes. A very worrying prospect as expressed in source two is the possibility of a tie. in which the election would be given to the house of representatives. Each state only gets on vote so a representative representing 500,000 people would have as much say as representatives representing 35 million people. ",3,2,167

The Indefensive Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong

"".

"" Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of elcetors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to cote for [John] Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide elcetion, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes.""

BC2CAB7DB6F0,"Conclusion.This can cause someone to come home late and not have time for homework. This will cause the student to have a bad grade on his progress report or report card. There can also be times when three different classes all have a major grade assignment due and they were all due at the same date. A player might not be home enough to do the project. They might also have a game that day. If they don't do there homework they wont be able to play, but if they don't come to a game they might get kicked off the team. So having a B average is like trying to win a losing battle for someone on a sports team. ",3,2,122

Under the 23rd Amendmentof the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposesof the Electoral College.

Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of Electors.I know the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's politicail party, but state law vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are ..

C28B8FFF66DE,Conclusion.because there are 5 different methods of choosing the president. ,0,0,11
C28B8FFF66DE,"Conclusion.paper comes from trees and many animals and wild life have homes in trees. with electoral college one wouldnt need paper to vote, which is a paper saver. the electoral college helps a lot when it comes to selecting electors,metting of the electors and where they wil vote for the president, and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. by saving gas one is saving money which can be used for any nessessitites. ",3,1,79
C28B8FFF66DE,"Conclusion.it doesnt require one to travel anywhere,whch saves gas and money. with the oney saved one can buy the nessessities that are needed. the electoral college offers a lot by just being a process. it helps save paper and money,whch is good for wild life and humans. 
",3,1,50
C28B8FFF66DE,"Conclusion.the first method is that certainty of outcome.. it states that a dispute over the outcome of an elecotral college vote is possible and it happened in 2000,but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. a winning candidats share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. for example, in the elections that happened in 2012, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney, b ecause almsot all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis,ev en a very slight. method number 2 is everyone's president. the electoral college requires a presidental candidate to have trans-regional appeal. no region(south,northeast,etc)has eneough electoral votes to elect a president. method 3 is swing states. the winner-take all method  of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates-as we saw in 2012's election-to focus their campain efforts on the toss-up states. voters in toss-up states are more likely to poay more attention to the campain-to really listen to the competing candidates, knowing that they are gouing to decide the election. method 4 is big states. the electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population0 losy by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the consitutuion. mthod 5 is avoid run-off elections. the electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. ",3,0,252
C28B8FFF66DE,"Concluding Statement.Mr. senate you should keep electoral ollege because it saves paper,saves gas and because it shows us the 5 methods that should be used for choosing the president. the electoral college offers a lot to wild life and also to humans by savikng trees and gas, which saves us humans money that one can spend on nessessities.    ",1,0,60
C2A49B846D05,"Conclusion.These electors cast their vote depending on the votes that we (you and I), cast. These electors that we choose are generally very trustworthy and reliable, being the reasons we choose these government officials to elect our government leaders. Sadly, however, not everybody is who they say they are, as we all have flaws and sins; occasionally one of these electors will be unfaithful and vote for the canidate they deem fit, instead of who we have chosen ourselves. Although this is rare, the possibilities would be negated completely if we simply had direct, individual voting. ",3,2,97
C2BAF4ADA2CA,Conclusion.I am in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the election of the president of the United States. Over sixty percent of voters prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. I believe this change would make electing a president much more simple ,5,0,49

Aha see you thought you won the 4v4 but really it's just getting started. Like how can you win if you don't know anything about the process college well thank godness im here because im gonna educate you goats. According to paragraph 2 ""The Electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president,and the counting of the electoral votes by congress"".

C4804C3EEBD7,"Conclusion.because there could be problems over the outcome of an Electoral College, the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. A candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. Voters in toss-up are more likely to pay close intention to the campaign, knowing that they are going to decide the election. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the vote cast. It also restores some weight in the political balance. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. The Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. ",3,1,147

Their are five reasons for retaining the electoral college despite its lack of impressive democratic origin & history; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons ",4,0,85

C48AEB2F1FC2,"Conclusion.The elctoral college also avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss up states. Votes in the toss up states are more likely to pay attention to the campaign- to really listen to the competing candidates- knowing that they are going to decide the election.

C492123F426E,"Conclusion.Driverless cars were always thought to be a thing of the past, but the reality is that they are a thing of the present and have been for many years. The writing points out that, "" Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009."" (Paragraph 2). While many people view driverless cars as a thing of the future, Google has formed them to be a thing of the now. This technology, that has been sought after for generations, is now readaly available. It was even said that Tesla has released plans to come out with a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time in 2016. (Paragraph 10). Knowing that these cars are being released this year is over the top of many peoples head, and shows that the development of these cars is indeed helpful. Knowing that the technology is already out in the world shows that the development of these cars grow every single day. This growth will positivly effect the automotive industry, and keep the people making these cars coming out with new and safe versions of these driverless cars. ",3,2,193
C4B52CBE6186,"Conclusion.Another claim that the face is actually a land form and was not created by aliens is that in paragraph twelve is it giving us a very clear and precise meaning that the Face is an landform by telling us that, "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. ""That a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

He had phenomenal work habits, but the technology confused him and although he understood the content, failed the course because of lack of guidance with technology. This is proof that not having anyone to help in means of technology or clarity, prevents one from full potential. Guidance is very essential to one's success, whether it be for clarity or not understanding how to operate advanced technology. Online courses open more problems than they solve because of simple misunderstandings that could be solved with personal guidance. ",3,2,133
C579A4D6151E,Conclusion.The final reason that attending school from home is not beneficial is that their would be a loss of social skills that a student learns while being in school. ,0,2,30
C579A4D6151E,"Concluding Statement.Overall, attending classes from home does not benefit students in the long run because there is an absence of guidance, personal connections with teachers, and social skills. All of these ideas are critical in a teenagers life and taking online classes prevents this. Schools should steer away from this new way of teaching and should attempt to maintain the current standards of teaching. The education of a student is very important, and the school system should do everything in its capability to improve it.           ",1,2,86
C5A56B482FAA,Conclusion.Some students have learning disabilities that prevent them from learning to the standard that reaches a B average or above.

C5A56B482FAA,Conclusion.There is no statement that this is because sports or other activities are preventing a higher grade. It is possible that the students do not understand the topics as well because they are not being taught how they need to be taught. ,3,0,43

C9CAB778C94E,"Conclusion.It also means that larger states have the advantage, because they get more votes, like California (55), Texas (38), and Florida (29), while smaller states get less, such as Alaska (3), Rhode Island (3), and Hawaii (4). Just to add insult to injury, this means that larger states are more fought over by politicians, leaving smaller states practically ignored. This is unfair to people in the Dakotas or Montana have no information to base their votes on, instead just picking a canidate by mainly party affiliation. the biggest political battles are in fact fought over the biggest states, in the forms of advertisements and propaganda. Although the propaganda is truely just that: propaganda, there is some truth in them, and the voters in bigger states are more well versed in the political and practical advantages of one canidate over the other. Article 3, while defending the Electoral College, in fact condems itself, by saying that voters in so called ""swing states,"" where there is no true dominant party, are likely to be given the most information on the canidates as they battle over who will get that state's votes in the college. The same thing can be said for the bigger states, because neither politician can really afford to let the other gain the upper hand in that state. Therefore smaller states, or states that are basicly marooned on one party are ignored or disregarded as worthless and unattainable in any case, so they widthold information from them, forcing them to vote blindly in favor of whichever party they choose, which votes may be discarded anyway. With an uncensored popular vote, the political canidates will be forced to advertise for all of the united states, instead of just the bigger or indevisive states. this will also remove all of the unfair advantages from the larger states, including more information as well as an unfairly weighted voting system.

CBC776495BE0,"Conclusion.The electoral college imposes on the American freedom and right to choose their president. The United States of America is a representative democracy. The citizens choose who they want to lead but those votes aren't truly their own votes. According to Richard A. Posner of source 3, ""...the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidental candidate, you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" American citizen votes do not matter as much as we think they should. The founding fathers built this country for the people. The people should have an actual voice in who they want to lead this great nation. In addition, Americans should have a direct say. Votes should go straight to the president and not the party's electors. This is not only fair to citizens but also a more relible plan. Bradford Plumer of source 2 explains to us that """"faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" We can't depend on these electors to determine one of the most important things of this country. We can't depend on these ""faithless"" electors to vote who we want when they might do the opposite. Voting by popular vote prevents these mishaps and restores our democracy. ",3,2,234

CC787397F33B,Conclusion.A presidential candidate makes many a promise during their race for Chief Executive and there is no way to be completely certain that these oaths will hold true. The same goes for the Electoral College. Citizens must have faith in the candidate as they would in the presidential election that they will put their country or state before personal wants and carry out their responsibilities honestly. The Electoral College process requires trust like any other form of election. ,6,2,79
CC96CF4D3854,"Conclusion.The winner-takes all system gives all the electors to the presidential candidate who won. This system disregards that the opposing candidate received any votes, because all the electors are given to the winner. This doesn't give a chance to the candidates whose party is not necessarily popular in that state. Candidates, therefore spend more time and money campaigning in states they know their party is popular in. According to Bradfor Plumer in 2000, 25 of the largest media markets did not see a campaign ad, because they lived in one of the seventeen states that had no campaigning. Some candiates don't even campaign in some states based on this. ",3,2,110

CD33A5B0A307,"Conclusion.In 2012 the election for president, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to Romneys 51.3. Because most states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, the slightest plurality in a state can cause a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. Though a tie is possible because the total number of votes is 538, it is very unlikely. ",3,0,63
CD33A5B0A307,Conclusion.No state has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The voters in toss-up states are more likely to be the thoughtful voters. A large state will recieve more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.    ,3,0,61

CF43485AE351,"Conclusion.For example, if a student's schedule is comprised of Algebra II, Biology, US History, and English Language and Composition, if the student is strong in math, he or she will likely speed through the course, allotting more time to the other subjects. If the online classes are based upon pace, students can get through subjects quicker, rather than being forced to remain in a class for an hour and a half. This results in students having more time to engage in the activities they are passionate about while having more flexible schedules. Why is this significant? Well, for example, places like INOVA have volunteer programs for kids to help senior citizens that require people to work from 12 pm-3 pm on weekdays. A regular student could not possibly participate in that program, regardless of how passionate he or she is about helping the elderly. Alternatively, if a student had an idea for a groundbreaking research project that he or she must complete in a lab, the student could devote more time to developing their procedure and collecting data than before. Attending school in person, regularly, will likely be an obstacle for these students, as a nearly 8 hour long school day with four hours of homework and mandatory extracurriculars does not leave sufficient time for the students to pursue their dreams ",3,2,222
CF84C9D788A9,"Conclusion.Why is the world like this? I know it is simply not because community service is bad. I know for sure that is wrong, or is it because people today are too lazy?

CF84C9D788A9,"Concluding Statement.This is what I think of community service, and outstanding way of showing our gratitude to our communities. Please think about this and ask yourself this.

While humans are not in any way perfect drivers, the natural instincts and reactions of a human behind the wheel are impossible to capture in the form of sensors, robots, or mechanincs of any kind. In situations where unorthodox solutions are needed to remain in control of the car and keep from crashing, veteran drivers have the knowledge and experience to do so.

D1ACADAC5ED4,"Conclusion.Many students come into school even if they are sick. This causes an illness to spread around the entire student body just because one student couldn't miss class. On the other hand, if a student stays home because they are sick, they miss a lot of classwork and aren't able to pay attend the important lessons being taught. One time, I had to stay home because of a stomach bug. I got behind in my classes and was never really able to understand the concepts as well as I could have if I was taught by my teacher like everyone else. I got a very bad grade on the test on these concepts because I was not able to catch up. If I was able to call in to my missed classes, I would have benefited greatly because I could ask questions if I had any, hear the teacher's explanation, and see how the teacher would solve the problem instead of having to figure it all out on my own. On a more serious level, there are some kids who are, unfortunately, terminally ill. They are either physically unable to go to school because of their type of illness or aren't allowed to go out very often because of the risks and dangers they could face. They are more prone to your typical cold and flu, and it is deadlier for them. If they were able to sit in on their classes through a video conference, then they could still feel like they are going to high school like a ""normal"" teenager. Overall, even if attending classes online was only available to those who are sick, it would still help so many kids. ",3,2,284

D34054ADD2FB,"Conclusion.The Electoral College is a system which was established to elect the president of the United States of America. In this system, each state receives a group of electors. The number of electors each state is awarded is based on the representation a state has in Congress. The total number of electors per state equals the number of people a state has in the House of Representative plus the two senators a state has. In a state, the electors pledge to vote for the candidate who wins the popular vote ",4,0,91
D34054ADD2FB,Conclusion.This system is simply unneeded in modern times and is unneccesarily complicated. The Electoral College must be abolished. ,5,2,19
D34054ADD2FB,"Conclusion.Citizens' wishes will not always be equivalent to what the electors vote for. This occurs partly because of the winner-take-all system. In this system, the winner of the popular vote in an individual state wins all of the electoral votes a state has. According to the Office of the Federal Register, all but two states use this system. These two states are Nebraska and Maine. As a result of the winner-take-all system, it is possible that a presidential candidate loses the overall popular vote, but wins more electoral votes and thus wins the election. This occurance happened in the infamous 2000 election, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost to George W. Bush by a mere five electoral votes. If the public indicated they wanted Al Gore as president, why should Bush have won due to this unfair system? It simply doesn't make sense. The winner-take-all system also results in political campaigns to focus their efforts in only certain regions. Some states very predictably vote either for the Republican candidate or for the Democratic candidate. Take Texas, for instance, which has traditionally always voted red. A Democratic candidate knows he should not focus his campaign in Texas, because he realizes his best efforts won't allow him to win the popular vote there and thus win the electoral votes. Because of the tendencies of certain states, many electoral votes are practically predetermined. The states which do not typically only vote in favor of one side are labelled ""swing states"". With the way the Electoral College works, the few states which are a toss-up carry the most weight. Presidential candidates will usually spend most of their time in these swing states, and very little time in others. For example, in the 2000 election, seventeen states were not visited by either candidate. Supporters of the Electoral College view the disproportional focus of campaigns as a positive. According to Richard A. Posner's article in favor of this corrupt system, ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constituion...""

I am telling you not to do this to kids because, it is not right to take this away from them. Maybe if they start participating in other school activities such as, math counts, the academic team, and so on, this could help kids bring up there grade in certain areas.

D6B7EE7B040D,"Conclusion.Self-education is, unsurprisingly, when a student independently seeks out and digests information, whether it is needed for school or not. Self-education can also have a profound effect on students, whether by giving them a higher grade on a test, or leading them to decide on a college major based off of a topic that they find to be interesting. To use myself an example, I have been educating myself on matters of Astronomy, Military History, and Geography for approximately 7 years now. In that time, I have participated in three state-level geography competitions, the second of which ranked me as third in the state in knowledge of Ancient Geography. In Astronomy, my self-education allowed me to get full marks on almost every Astronomy-related assignment in school, and in Military History, perhaps my strongest subject, I have connected myself with various historians and am currently making inroads into publishing work of my own design in a Military Journal.

D9436DDEB3C4,Concluding Statement.In conclusion changing the way people vote is easier for everybody. It saves time for electors and it gives people a chance to see who they are really voting for. Presidents would have to go to each state and appeal to them in order to get a vote. I belive that is what we need. They would be required to actually work for a position in office rather than speaking on whjat they are going to do and paying someone else to elect them. We should have faith in our president and know who we are voting for before we cast our vote. This system seems more fair and more modern to the twenty first century. This is a system most Americans would agree with. ,1,2,127

Sometimes is good to make friends because they can help you or be with you in someway is good to go school then taking at home or online. Also if they do it online or at home they are going to be more prepared and ready for wet ever situation because they was putting attention in their lessons. But being in a group in school is more interesting because you can meet new people and don't be alone doing the work but everything have their good choices for do it and people can decide how they want to do it or how much they want lo learn. ,3,1,125
DA86BC9B9FB6,"Conclusion.I think it will be a good choice for them to do it online. For example if they are doing work in a group they are talking and don't concentrated but if they are with nobody they can work better and do their work. This can be the reason for more people take that classes because they work better with out no one else. The people who studies online or at home are more intelligent, and learn more because they are concentrate in what they are doing. In sometimes in the schools they are not concentrate because they are playing or talking with their friends and that can distract people. If they make a competition an student who studied on line or at home with one student is a regular school I think the student is not on the school can win because sometimes that students are more prepared then the regular school. Also sometime the students who go to a regular school they just go for play with their friends is good to have some friends but they are not concentrate o they are sleeping when the teacher is explaining and then when they do the exam or quiz they fail. But if one student is studding online or at home they are listening for when they have to take the exams they can pass and are more responsible with that. ",3,0,233

The elctoral college is anachronism and it's time we should be open minded and look in to the future and rely on the Americans votes we should not rely on 538 people to vote for the millions of people we have in America. Even if we had a combination of  the popular vote with elctoral college that would make it more fair than just having the electoral college pick the president they want in office. ",3,1,140

DE2E4AFB2721,"Conclusion.each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, and that trust is rarely betrayed"" (Source 3, Paragraph 2). So when the party selects their electors they are most likely to select the candidate of the party they were selected by. There is also regional appeal,if a president only has diserably mojority of vores in a certain region of the country he is ""unlikely to be a succesful president""( Source 3, Paragraph 5) . This is because if a president is only desired by a certain region and not the rest of the country, the wants of the rest of the country aren't met and he most likely will not tend to the needs of them, and ultimately doesn't have a chance of being selected as president. Finally, when no candidate for president has a clear majority of votes, the electoral college's votes gove a clear winner and a candidate is selected. ",3,2,158

E09853233CCF,Conclusion.No one else should vote for them. The people have the right to choose who ever they want. And no one has the right to vote for any other person but them ,3,1,33
E09853233CCF,"Conclusion.First, there really is no way of cheating in the popular vote method because people vote once for whom ever they want to be president out of the people elected and then the president is chosen that way. The popular votes method is more fair because candidates spend a little time in every if not majority of the states, depending on how much time they have. But as stated in the article written by Bradford Plumer in the electoral college voting method ""candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" That is not fair every state should be able to see the candidates who are going to be serving the country and see what they are like and how they can help the country. And this has happened before where the candidates didn't even bother showing up in some of the states. One example would be as stated in the article By Bradford Plumer ""during the 2000 campaign, seventeeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Now how on earth can people vote for their new president if they have absoloutley no idea of what the president is capable of doing to help or even hurt the country. ",3,0,240

E264A3F27D5C,"Conclusion.In a situation like this, it doesn't even matter what the popular vote results are becasue the College still gets their unique say in the presidency.

E39559BF14F2,"Conclusion.Some children have busier and more complicated lives compared to others. For example, some children are raised in households that their parent guardian struggles financially. When a child is raised into a financially struggling household, he or she will busy themselves by working a full-time job. A child who is raised into a household like this will work full-time because they will do anything it takes for them to be financially stable on their own in their future. A child who works a full-time job, typically doesn't have enough time out of his or hers day to attend a public school. But, he or she will have the opportunity of having extra time to prepare themselves for their future. In a hypothetical situation like this, online classes and video conferencing from home would be very beneficial to students who are born into households were they have no choice but to busy themselves and to be an independent because they can't be dependent on their parent guardian.

E3EC600A1754,"Conclusion.When the electors pick the president, they look at their background, such as, what school they attend, what they studied, where they were born, etc. They pick someone they trust to do the job. When there is a Run-off Election, the House Of Representatives picks the president. I personally think this is a good thing because they picked the person who would do best in the job by gathering everyone's vote to decide it. Because no country could have two presidents with two vice presidents. ",3,0,86
E3EC600A1754,"Conclusion.For example, Romney was in the South region, and he knows he wouldn't have to do much there because of that was where he was currently from. Now lets compare that to someone that was in the area around North Dakota. He would most likely not win that many votes since it's only three electoral numbers. So the Electoral College gives a chance for the president they chose to win because of where they used to be located in order to get the most popular and electoral votes.

E63689D747FA,"Conclusion.In 2000 there was a election crisis that broke out it was the biggest one. The states leislatures are technically responsible for picking the electors and picking this people they can defy eneyone.

Back in 1960 a louisiana legislature succeeded in replacing the democratic elector with a new one. Electors had refused to vote for their party's candidate and it happened in hawaii 1960. The vice president at the time had made sure that everything was back to normal ",3,1,80

E721598E54AB,"Conclusion.""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president........Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, soemtimes the presidential candidate themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. DO voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candiate?

E740029E13D1,"Conclusion.In the article "" In Defenese of the Electoral College"" the author states a good claim. Richard states "" the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"". From this quote Richard points out the even when a candidate has a good amount of  popular vote it all comes down to the Electoral College. The reason is the Electoral College is part of the candidate's team, whether its Democrat or Republican. In the article from Richard he gave an example, "" Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney"". In this peice of information Richard clearly states on how the Electoral College is stronger then the popular votes. ",3,2,136
E740029E13D1,"Conclusion.Now no one would know if this is true but the electors might have their reasons. But Richard A. Posner comes back and states ""no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. In this quote its supports the fact that the electors do choose who they please.

Also the electoral college will be trust wirthy because the college follows the majority of the people's vote, and then makes a vaild decision. ",6,2,89

E85C45D90D1D,"Conclusion.Secondly, a schedule is very important in maintaining a balanced day. Having classes aligned for the week can enable students to practice time management and help them be alert for appropriate times throughout each day. To my friend, having a schedule is extremely important. Without one, she gets concerned that she will not be able to accomplish what needs to get done. To combat this fear, she creates lists, with scheduled times, that allow her align her personal schedule with her tasks. Similarly to my friend, students need to able to see what they need to learn in that day and get it done. They can work on getting to class on time, and due to breaks and meals throughout the day, they can relax knowing that their time is planned out for them. This ability is lost when students make choices as to when they feel like taking their online or video conference classes ",3,2,156
E85C45D90D1D,"Conclusion.Lastly, the school environment is made for learning. Classrooms have helpful posters and worksheets that guide students in their learning. The walls are usually soundproofed, and teachers help to prevent distractions. This setup is in direct contrast to a home environment. Also, being present in the classroom helps to prevent technology malfunctions and poor connection that could be disruptive or deteriorate the student's ability to learn. ",3,2,67

E9938C48F7AB,"Conclusion.After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ' certificate of Ascertainment' listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors.

Your states certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the congress and the national Archives as part of the offical records of the presidential election. ",3,1,89
E9938C48F7AB,"Conclusion.Also, most States have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all the electors to the winning presidential candidate. however, maine and Nebraska each have a variation of 'proportional representation'.

If you are given the chance that your car does not need you and you do get bored off of the heads up display, what would you really do? Since our society is all about iphones and samsung , I do not think that its safe to be in a car with your cell phones on.

EA426FFE25E5,"Conclusion.With the face on mars no one belived that it was actually a face they thought that it was and ancient monument on mars and when NASA first saw the face on mars they thought that it was the landging place of the viking 1's sister ship the viking 2. Then when they put that photo out of the face on mars people were using it in haunted grocery stores checkout lines, radio talk shows, magazines, books, and hollywood films.

Then even some scientists belived that they face was an alien artifact so when people did not belive them they went and took more picture of the face but it was mars cloudy day and people still did not belive them. So NASA went back for another one but to get a better picture they had to get closer to the face and role the ship twenty five degrees to the center they also had to go over the face very often because it was hard to get the picture.

The spaceship would look over mars like a faxing machine but lucky for them going around the face very often it got to a point to were their was no clouds and they were able to get a good shot of the face. So NASA was able to get a better picture of the face so that people would belive them that it was a face in the surface on mars.

The face was not accutally formed from the viking 2 but from a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same hight as the Face on the moon. So the face on mars was alo just a huge rock formation and the eyes nose and mouth was just an illussion formed from a shadow. Also about the alien articact their was not one they thought that their was a hidden alien artifact and hidden alien marking hidden by the haze. ",3,1,327
EA5BFD706570,"Conclusion.For example, my friend Kady does gymnastics with me, and gymnastics meets happen almost every weekend.

There's less stress about having to do homework for the next day ",3,0,59
EA5BFD706570,"Conclusion.Many students may feel better and be less stressed doing homework or school work, because of being in the comfort of their own home or in a space that is safe for them. Students feel free to take breaks and not be restricted to the overcrowded rooms that are common in regular schools. It's also proven that surroundings have an effect on mood and willingness to learn. If the atmosphere of a classroom is sad, depressing, or gloomy, then students may have a gloomy or depressing attitude when in that class, hindering them from learning at their fullest potentials. With online schools, the student chooses their place of study and knows what places motivate them to create high quality work and retain the most information. ",3,2,126
EA5BFD706570,"Conclusion.Although online education is flexible, school work still needs to be completed in a timely manner and it is the students responsibility to get it done, for there is no one around to set verbal due dates. Students still need to write papers in online school, but the only difference is there is no teacher to remind you of the due date and pressure you to complete it. Later in life, those online students are very aware of due dates and deadlines,for they have been accustomed to following them throughout their high school careers. Employers like employees who are punctual and have tasks or assignments done on time. This idea of time management also prepares the student for college if they choose to go to an actual college or university. Professors like assignments done on time and also won't give too many frequent reminders on when those assignments are due. Professors also like when students take accountability for their actions. It's not the teachers fault if work is not completed on time or is lost. The blame is solely put on the student. ",3,2,185

The Constitution states that we are able to vote for our president, but then what do you call this? This is not an example of what America stands for, and this is certainly not the voting system that is described by our nation's properties. There is another issue with this violation of rights concerning our voting system, it's how the Electoral College votes and how dependable they are. The article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong."" talks about how you can't control who the electorals you chose vote for. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" This statement helps prove that the president you may want may not even get you vote. The Electoral College not only takes away your right to assuringly vote for the president of your choice, but it also takes away right personal voting right as an American.

And the thing is that the senate would choose the vice-presendent. because each state cast only one vote, the single representative from wyoming, representing 5000,000 votes would have sa much say as the 55 representative from carofornia, who represent 35 million votes.

The Electoral college is a process. That consists of people that are in congress that help vote for the Presient and Vice President.

The Electoral college consists of 538 elector, But there must be a majority of the 270 electoral votes to elect the next President. Your state's entitle allotment of electors equal to the members in the congress at a time. There most be one house of representetives plus there most be two senators in each states. In congress to make the vote go though.

Under the 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the District of Columbia is allocate  3 electors. They are treated like they are a state that is in the united states, But most people just call them District of columbia.

Each state has a candidate that running for president in there state. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but there a lot of states that are not like that and the vote on who they believe in. Who they think that is going to do the best job as president.

The president election is held every four years. no president can be president more then twice, but there was one person had more then two but that was a thing that happend because there was a war going on.

The presiential election is held every four years on the first tuesday after the first monday on November. you help choose the next president of the united state. but only if you are 18 you can not vote before you are 18.

Most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards alll electors to the winning presient candidate. However, maine and nedraska each have a variation of

"" proportional representation. ""

After the president election, your governor prepares a ""certificate of ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your along with the names of their respective electors. the certificate of ascertianment also declares the winner of the president election that in there state at the meeting of the electors in december of the election year. your state's certificates of ascertainments are sent to the congress an the national archives as a part of the official records of the presiential election.                                                                                                                            ",3,1,418

After that, the votes between the two presidents are seperate, while the one vote goes for the president of their chosen and the other vote goes towards the other president of their chosen. This process would make everything fair and the majority of the vote doesn't just counts as state. ",3,1,73

F68A995107BE,"Conclusion.The journey to school is different for every student. For some an easy five minuet walk will get them to school with no worries, others a fifteen minuet bus ride, and for few a treacherous path lies between their house and their nearest public school. This situation could prevent a child from attending a public school at all, or make it very difficult to attend everyday. The family shouldn't have to move from the house they love for their children to attend school. The distance learning program would be able to fix this situation. Fortunately for the family, with the distance learning program, the student would be able to video conference the schools from the comfort of their home. Personally, I know a program like this would benefit families like my cousins family who lives far out of the way and struggles to drive to school every morning because public school transportation does not go far enough to reach where they live. This program would take the stress off the family and continue to allow the student to attend public school. ",3,2,182

F6F60CA6E983,Conclusion.beacause it has worked this long for us so we know its gonna work so why not keeep it going. ,0,0,21
F6F60CA6E983,"Conclusion.It keeps a steady stream when it comes time to vote because aslong as someone had 270 votes you know thats who will get picked. so why try changing that and have a whole new system put in and then not know what to do when it comes time to vote. And what if the new system dosent work, what if the new way of the voting process messes with the tallys and they come out wrong and no one will get picked, unlike the other way when u know everything will come out right and u know that we will have a president. I think its fair that they have it set at 270 for voting that way everyone havs a chance to vote instead of it being so low that only a few people get to vote before they shut it down because they have reached there number of tallys that they need.  So if they change the number of tallys that a president needs to become president that will be stupid and people will act out on it because they wont think its right, and because the people who didnt vote will not like the fact that they didnt get to put there vote f in before they stoped the voting and because they meet the number that they needed. Its a vote why do they need to title it as a the vote of a president or a popular vote of a president. Why not just vote for there just electors instead of saying vote for your candidate when really you are just voting for the electors. If you are voting for a certin thing there is no reason that u have to re-word it just to vote, if you are voting for something do it the right way instead of changing stuff and making it seem one way when really its the other way. Why should the electoral get just as much as the winning presindent? They are not doing as much as the president  and who is helping him out.. so they should not get the same reword.    ",3,1,355

F739195A9518,"Conclusion.For example, at home, a student may be tempted to watch television, or take a nap as there is no teacher or administrator to effectively enforce certain rules and guidelines on the student. This situation makes a student's ability to stay on task extremely difficult, hence negatively impacting that student's success academically. However, if the student were taking classes at school, they are required, by the teacher, to focus on the lesson and complete tasks in a timely manner for their grade. Taking classes at home allows a student to procrastinate their assignments, with no tangible consequence. Because of this, distance learning allows students to take advantage of their freedoms at home, which, in the long run, has a unfavorable effect on that student's academic success. ",3,2,127
F739195A9518,"Concluding Statement.Distance learning, the concept of making at-home classes an option for students, is unsupported due to the fact that it does not promote the same motivation as a classroom, allows students to take advantage of their freedoms at home, and does not allow student's to develop their interpersonal skills.

For an example It's like taking care of your room, what if one day you decided not to put things in there proper places and just threw things anywhere and left it untidy? It might begin to smell, or you might even discover things missing. So taking care of our community is like taking care of own self. Doing this could be a really good deed, giving back to the community to make it a healthier place.

F744ABAAC3FB,Conclusion.There's nothing wrong wit people voting for the president ,5,1,10
F744ABAAC3FB,"Conclusion.Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO, in their time , agreed on? Abolishing the electoral college. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.

Who picks the electors? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central comittee, sometimes the presidentail canidates themselves. Voters can't controls whom their electors vote for. Well not always .Voters sometimes get very confused about the votes in vote for the wrong canidate.

The best arguement against the electoral college is called Disater Factor. The Americans should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election in a century. Back in 1960, segregations in Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratics with new electors that would oppose John F. Kennedy.

The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the canidates who recieve the most votes. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, it happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over popular vote.

The Electoral College requires a presidential Canidate to have trans-regional appeal. No other region ( South, Northwest, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes. The electoral College avoids the problems of elections in which no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. For an example, nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes.           ",3,1,278

I'm sure many people in those sates such as South Carolina and Rhode Island had a lot of input to add in the 2000 campagin but because they were little minority states they werent focused on as much as the other larger staes. This is very unfair and judgementally to these states because the Electoral College is based on involuntary effects, the inhabitants of North Caiolina or Rhode Island cannot control where they choose to live, they might have to live in the certain geograpic location because of finaces or religous persecution.

With this, this shows that the state votes are important and essential to the canidates who are trying to obtain electoral votes in the states.

Since most of the time Congress has a party that makes up a majority of it, it would be very unfair to allow them to pick the president. It's also possible that even if a majority of the people vote for a president, the electoral votes elect the other candidate instead, like what happened to Al Gore in 2000. An election like this just has too many holes and pitfalls to be efficient. The holes need to be repaired before we can actually use this as our primary way to select a president, or else we're setting ourselves up to have problems in the future. ",3,2,127

Though this method works, you may be blind sided and not be able to see both parts of your solution. Rather than doing a yes or no poll, asking people for advice and instead, writing them down and grouping them together by what they mean is a better way to conduct a poll.

15EAD0CC9F3D,"Conclusion.For starters, online courses allow for better understanding between one another, as methods such as video conferencing eliminates the background noises that makes it difficult to for the student to converse with the teacher and vice versa.

15EAD0CC9F3D,"Conclusion.On the other hand however, online courses are usually uniform with how they teach people, as they have clear and typed wording while also providing the users other forms of information sources to further develop their knowledge of the subject. This makes it easier for the viewers to follow and have a deeper understanding of the given concept, as they can simply backtrack onto the previous sections of the course without requiring the hassle of requesting the teacher to explain a concept again verbally, which often promotes tedious work ethics with teachers having to explain or rephrase the idea repeatedly until the class understands the idea before moving on.

16D2B327B978,"Conclusion.In classrooms, students get the chance to learn through interaction by participating in labs, presentations, class discussions, and many other interactive experiences. Students can use presentations and class discussions to bounce ideas off of each other, and if a student has a question after a lesson, they do not have to email or call the teacher back, they can simply go up and ask to get the information they need right away. There are lots of students who state that they learn better through visuals and hands on experiences. Those who take classes at home do not have the opportunity to have a real hands on learning experience, which for some could alter how much material their brain actually grasps on to. Students would not be able to physically pick apart the subject they are learning, especially in science areas, which could lead them to not obtain as much information as they could have with an interactive experience.

21C75B3F290A,"Conclusion.The main purpose of school has always been one goal: to educate the student and teach them how to learn. But inside schools many distractions are present. The social life of a student, whether that be talking to another student during class, or interactions in the hallway, has become a huge distraction to learning. However, with distance learning, these distractions would be eliminated. Of course, at-home learning will open up the possibility of home distractions, but the number of distractions will certainly be less than the number of distractions at school. With this removal of distractions, a new focus on learning is produced, one that is much more stress-free. ",3,2,110
21C75B3F290A,"Conclusion.A more stress-free learning experience, due to the removal of school-related distractions, would make the process of learning much more effective for the student, fulfilling the main goal of schools: to educate the student and teach them how to learn ",0,2,41

22D938F5E0E2,"Conclusion.There was a study done at Workman State College where scientist studied students who stayed home for the whole school day and then studied students who actually went to school for the whole day. Both groups of students were learning the same material, the group at home got a video of their teacher explaining everything exactly the same as what she taught in class. Half of students at home did not talk to a single person the whole day that they were at home, meanwhile, the students at school had many conversations with other peers and teachers. Throughout the day, the students who stayed at home lost 10% of there overall social communication skills and did worse on a pop quiz about the information that was being taught by their teacher. This study exemplifies that if you were to stay at home and miss even just one day of school you would miss out on many social lessons like peer project and even just normal conversations that are experiences that can strengthen you socially for the future.

22D938F5E0E2,"Conclusion.What is truly important about getting up in the morning and going to a gigantic building filled with hundreds of people is that it is filled with family, friends, neighbors, and even strangers. Meeting all of these people and learning new things about them can really strengthen the school-wide community connections. Advancements with technology also help us by letting students connect with other people in their community, but technology also doesnt help us if we are letting students attend classes online through video conferences. Doing so would cause a major lack of enthusiasm and relationships within a community. Going home independently and working on classwork without getting the chance to learn about your teacher or other classmates through this safe environment at school, causes a total downfall on community awareness.

23C6ED53A179,"Conclusion.Setting up a poll on an Instagram story or Twitter is a prime example of this. Sometimes, you will see people posting a poll for what they should wear to an event. When that poll is over, you get to see which option got the most votes, and that can help you make your final decision. I have set up polls on Twitter many times trying to figure out what to draw, what music I should listen to, and of course, what color I should dye my hair next. These majority polls have really helped me make decisions in the past, and I will continue to use these polls. ",3,2,110
23C6ED53A179,"Concluding Statement.These are the reasons I believe that asking multiple people for advice can really help you make decisions. Choices in general are very hard to make, especially if you're an indecisive person like I am, so asking other people for help is something I do often. I've received plenty of good advice from when I've had issues with my family or other friends, and with the advice I was given, I was able to make the best choice I could. Even if someone else's opinion is unwanted at the time, later on you can really think about what that person said, and you can choose what to do. I believe that a lot of the good choices I've made in my life are all thanks to my friends, who help me out. Through them and others, I will continue to take advice and make the best choices.

287F79B6D6F6,"Conclusion.First, students will not benefit from attending online classes at home as they will get easily distracted. ",0,2,18
287F79B6D6F6,"Conclusion.Students are often young and their brains have the power to rapidly grasp and process information. However, this ability can be negatively affected especially when the student is in an environment that they are well acquainted with. A well known area where students have limited interactions can dull their curiosity and aspirations for learning, causing boredom. This boredom is able to take over a young student's malleable mind and replace curiosity with distraction. In a world where technology is ubiquitous and can bring the world to one's fingertips, students would much rather research the latest scores of a basketball game or catch up on celebrity gossip, than they would learn about the Pythagorean theorem. At home, a student's mind is able to roam around freely, especially without an instructor prohibiting such distractions. Making it less likely that students are being attentive to the subject being taught on an online forum that limits their participation in the class. Therefore, students will not benefit from attending online classes at home as they will get easily distracted by the comforts in their home. ",3,2,181
287F79B6D6F6,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion, students will not benefit from attending online classes at home as they will get easily distracted and be less motivated to learn. If students are to properly balance their home life and their studies, a more reasonable approach that doesn't compromise their relaxation or student life needs to be found. Also, students who attempt to take an online class at home are more likely to be distracted by the comforts that are at their reach. The inability to forge relationships and connect with peers is another drawback of taking an online class at home. Likewise, the lack of opportunities to partake in in-class discussions creates barriers for students to succeed as active learners. Nobel Peace Prize winner and educational activist Malala Yousafzai once said,""a paper and pen can change the world."" Yousafzai overcame many hindrances before she could provide education to the girls in her village, so why do we undermine its importance? Education is a powerful tool that we must use to guide the future, it is not something that we can compromise on for comfort. ",1,2,183

2A4C1A1AD665,"Conclusion.It is easier to be reassured by multiple people, rather than one, because a group of people is more likely to think of more different ideas, than an individual person.

In contrast, a group of people may agree upon recommendations, or could even help the person, depending on the situation.

A lot of stress people get in there lives is from being without anyone to help them and that could really mess with a person's mind. Most of the times when people do have other people in their lives, they make the right choices. If they do good in school, they will most likely go to college, then they could work and level up to be a manager or have their own business.

You should never discredit your parent or guardians opinion because they could ultimately be correct when it's all said and done. However the minute you start only listening to your parents is the minute when your friends lose trust in you, and you lose trust in them. Remember that whenever a conflict is resolved or your problem is fixed you always have to credit someone for helping you with your problem and if that person is someone other than your parents than you have learned that your peers may be less experienced but they could be just as wise and just as intelligent as your parent or guardian.

One artist might suggest to use vibrant colors, while another might suggest dark colors.

Some people might be more carefree about it, while others might need to think more before they make a choice. Wanting to make the best choice is not selfish at all and is just a part of life.

When you take the time to get advice from others, you prevent yourself from making an impulsive decision. ",0,2,19
44A73349B60A,"Conclusion.Making a choice on impulse will rarely turn out well as you probably have very little knowledge and advice from others going behind it. It is when you step back and get advice from others that you prevent yourself from making these kinds of decisions. As an example, think about leaders in government. Often times they take a long time to make a decision as they hear from all of their advisers and take their time, as they do not want to make a impulsive choice. By forcing yourself to slow down and get advice form others, you are making better choices by having other's advice and making yourself think a little harder about what choice you are going to make. Getting advice does more than just slowing you down to make a better choice, it also allows others to make sure you are making one that will have serious consequences. ",3,2,152
44A73349B60A,"Conclusion.If you never took anybody else advice, you would have really no idea about what might happen as a result of your choice. Getting advice from other's on your problem would give you ideas about the consequences of the your choices, helping you to make a better decision. For example, let's say you have a dental problem where your front teeth don't have enough space to come out of your gum. You may go to a orthodontist who tells you that you would be fine if you just put braces on to give your teeth more space. Now let's say that you go to another orthodontist who tells you that just putting braces on may cause your back teeth to get bunched too close together, causing unnecessary pain. You just averted a crisis by simply getting advice from multiple people. By not being impulsive with your actions and getting advice form the people around you, you can make good decisions. ",3,2,161
44A73349B60A,"Concluding Statement.By getting advice from others, you can make good decisions, as people can give you insights into your problem and help you to make the best choice. When you simply get advice from others, your ability to make the right decision is greatly increased, as you can find more options, understand the problem better, discover some of the repercussions your decision may have, and find out what others think the best action for you to take is. By discovering all of this, you can make an informed decision based on it, which will almost always be better than an impulsive decision that could have serious consequences. Getting advice from others will always be helpful in making the right choices. ",1,2,121

4585DE769AE9,"Conclusion.Because when the students are in online or when they try to make video they are not going to take care them self. For example: I remember when I was six grade my friend PROPER_NAME was making online video. We went to classes from home to know how far it is. On that time she just focus on her video she wasn't focus on her way. After that, she try to cross the way but she still making video. She didn't saw the car she try to cross the road.

46B92194BDB8,Conclusion.Lack of structure that comes with attending class from home will lead to an increase in procrastination among students which in turn will decrease their quality of learning. ,0,2,29
46B92194BDB8,"Conclusion.Five day school weeks with consistent schedules provide students with some sort of structure to their education. Without a schedule assisting students with time management, they become accountable for their own learning. This is an issue because most adolescents don't have a passion for knowledge or simply do not know why they have to go to school which makes it difficult to invest their time into something they do not really want to do. For example, I am passionate about lacrosse. I am willing and able to invest consistent time and effort into improving my stick skills, strength, and endurance. With school, on the other hand, I find it difficult to invest the same amount of time and effort into a class or specific assignment I simply don't have that much interest in. It is not until I am forced to complete an assignment by a due date, or study for an upcoming assessment that I put in the effort necessary to succeed. However, with a structured number of hours that I must attend school each week, I am forced to absorb the knowledge required to eventually complete the work due in my classes. Most students who are not super passionate about school would much likelier not pay attention in an online class, or not even attend altogether. Online sessions will be ineffective on student participation, leading students to a lower quality of learning or even complete lack of education. It is completely dependent on the student's thirst for knowledge, which may not be that important to them. ",3,2,259
46B92194BDB8,"Concluding Statement.
The school system provides the adolescent generations with a structured path to developing knowledge as well as connections with fellow students and teachers that will greatly benefit them on their journey. Introducing online classrooms into education breaks the structure and neglects these important aspects to developing a quality understanding of knowledge effectively. Effective education is the gateway to a progressive future and the betterment of society as a whole.  ",1,0,71
4790D181C8D5,"Conclusion.From the time we were young children, like around the age of five, we were brought up that school was a necessity and that we had to go. Me, being a black girl and all,my parents always reminded me that my assessors fought for us to go to school: ""And you have no right not to go"". Up until 2017 all we ever knew was that public school is the only way you can get your education. Now, all that's changed, there's talk about distance learning; which is a way students can attend class from home by online courses, or video conferencing ",4,2,104
4790D181C8D5,"Conclusion.because it'll make cheating more frequent, ",0,0,7
4790D181C8D5,"Conclusion.School is about educating yourself, so you can take on the great big world. When students decide to do distance learning, they take on the decision to learn everything themselves. Yes there are plenty of online videos and teachers you can watch in order to learn the information needed for testing, but who's to say that they're giving one-hundred percent correct information. There are literally whole human beings that will willingly teach over seventy-five students each day just for you're convenience. When I was younger my teachers used to score my writings with a three out of five or either a two out of five. That may not seem that bad, but from a girl who gets four out of five or five out of five on essays now, that's such an accomplishment. Of course I can't give myself all the credit because I know that it was my former teachers who built me to become the writer that I am now. Teachers literally made a writer out of a girl who couldn't even spell ""great"" correctly ",3,2,178
4790D181C8D5,"Concluding Statement.Children need to stay in public schools and not participate in the at home distance learning. It isn't helping, nor benefiting the children of today's time.

4A292725EE82,"Conclusion.Getting advice from multiple people can be unnecessary or vital depending on how severe the issue is, and not a lot of people see the part where it's important to get advice from several different people.

4A292725EE82,"Conclusion.different solutions, ",0,2,3
4A292725EE82,"Conclusion.This is beneficial because, of course, past experience with the problem can lead to better advice than advice from someone that has never faced the problem. For example, person one, once again, is having trouble with the cursed car, so person one goes to person two, person three, person four, person five, person six, and person seven. Person two, person three, and person five all give some advice that they found on the internet, person four offers to help but really doesn't know what he/she is doing. Person six just shrugs and says, ""I don't know what to do."" But person seven was a car mechanic for a few years, and person one didn't know that. So person seven not only gives advice that helps fix the car's current problem, he/she also fixes it to the point where it doesn't break down twice every week. The point is, if you go to multiple people for advice, chances are, you'll find someone with hands-on experience that can help you with the problem. ",3,2,173

By the time we get up, get ready, travel to school, attend class, then come home to do additional homework, or entire day is gone. Additionally, we also spend five of the seven days of the week attending class, and those other two days of the weekend are overwhelmed with more homework. What about those who live far away? If they were at home, they would actually be able to get more work done as their commute time is absent. Where is their time allotted to spend time with family when your whole life is centered around school? Lastly, what about those who have a mental illness, that disables them to attend school for a whole day? ",4,2,130
4B47096239FB,Conclusion.Students would benefit to a great extent if they could take classes online ,5,0,14
4B47096239FB,"Conclusion.The commute time takes up hours of there day, especially if they ride the bus. School is only eight hours a day, but including travel time, the act of going to school can take up ten or more hours of an individual's 24 hour time period. This permits them from being able to get all there homework done, and can also make them more tired since they must get up early to travel, and then stay up late since they get home much later. This results in an unfocused student, who hardly pays attention in class and additionally, a student who doesn't get as much work done. With online classes, the travel time is absent. This allows a student to learn and work more. The student would have more time in the day to spend quality time working. This would result in a more focused, determined individual. ",3,2,148

4C3D01DA2767,Conclusion.Have you ever asked someone for advice? If so you might have asked multiple people. Some people say that it is good to ask more than one person for advice for different things. When you ask your friends they might tell you something different from what a family member might say. ,4,0,52
4C3D01DA2767,"Conclusion.when your parents said that you could never have a pet when you were a kid and now that you moved out you decide to get a puppy. You have planned this moment forever but you do not know what kind of dog you want to get. Say you were living in an apartment and the only breed of dog you cannot have is a Pit Bull but thats okay because you've always wanted a German Shepherd. So you find puppies for sale and go look at them and decide to buy one. But you did not do research and now you are lost and do not know what to do. You decide to ask your mom and she said to make sure you walk the puppy and make sure it gets enough exercise because it is a big dog. Then when you go get a check-up for the puppy you ask the vet and they say to make sure the puppy gets enough food, exercise, and water. Of course you go with what the vet said and now your puppy is the best looking dog in the whole apartment building. ",3,2,192
4C3D01DA2767,Concluding Statement.Getting advice from different people is helpful most of the time except when they all say the same thing but you do not agree with it. Asking multiple people gives you choices and I do not know about you but I like to have many different choices. Some people might give you bad advice and other people might give you good advice and thats why you should ask multiple people for advice.

4C471936CD75,"Concluding Statement.there are many other reasons one might want to seek multiple opinions and pieces of advice instead of just one, but these are the two main ones that I think really make it worthwhile to ask for advice from multiple people instead of making decisions with only one piece of advice from one person. The key thing that all of these examples have shown is that it is better to seek multiple opinions from multiple different people than to only get advice from one. This is ultimately because asking multiple people for advice makes you feel better about the decisions you make and also increases the chances that one or more of the people you consulted with gave you the right advice at the right time to empower you do what is right for you (or perhaps what is right for the country you happen to be in charge of!).                                                                              ",1,2,153

For example, a month ago, I was in the process of selecting my courses for freshman year, but I was unsure if I should take regular Geometry or Geometry Honors. So, I found a time to meet with my guidance counselor and asked her for her personal opinion. She believed that it would be a mistake if I took the honor class because she was afraid that I would be overwhelmed with the workload. After some thinking, I decided to ask for advice from my math teacher, who encouraged me to enroll in Geometry Honors because she'd noticed that I've consistently maintained outstanding grades since the beginning of the school year.

For example when a student is about to hand in an assignment they always have someone peer review/edit to add ideas or tell them what they think needs to be fixed. Most students do this because they want to have someone else view and improve on their work. By inputting the other persons opinions and using the advice that was given the student will turn in the better version of the assignment than what the student was about to turn in beforehand. ,3,2,112

Often times, this is true, especially when it comes to consumer goods. But, if the statement ""quality over quantity"" was always true, why is it not used on everything? Well, when it comes to opinions quality is only determined by your opinion of the opinion. That's why presidential elections use quantity not quality because opinions don't have an official quality. The same is applied to any survey or poll that exists, they all are based on the numbers. So, if the president, the leader of the country, is elected by numbers, why shouldn't you have your own little election when you are faced with a difficult decision and you can't decide what choice is better?

57846986862C,"Conclusion.While trying to make a difficult decision, your point of view of the problem can be limited as you are only one person. However, after asking more people for their own ideas and inputs into the situation, you will be able to look at the decision in a more broader view, and also how it can be made in many different ways. After asking other people what they think about the decision, they will be able to give you their own ideas and thoughts that they have, and the different pros and cons that come along with it. In each difficult decision, one of the elements that make the decision so difficult is the many pros and cons that correspond to each side of the decision. The decision is then comparing which side has the better pros and the least cons. Talking to other people might enable them to see the problem in a different way that you might see it, which can add to your list containing the pros and cons of each side of the decision. ",3,2,179
57846986862C,"Conclusion.Making this choice would make one feel more better and confident in one's self, knowing that there are many other people who agree with making that specific choice. However, if one wishes to use this strategy, they must also make sure that they are asking people who have experience and past knowledge in the decision to be made. A high-schooler who is deciding between two colleges and wishes to ask others on the college he should attend should not ask random strangers walking down the street. Instead, he should ask other gifted students, prestigious educators, or other intelligent adults who might know how to make a better decision than the student himself.

5B222B47AA21,"Conclusion.The other day I was watching a movie. The movie was about a court case in which jurors had to decide if a man was innocent or guilty. The trial gave a lot of useful information that was used in the decision making but, as they went deeper into the mystery, more information was brought to the table. At first twelve out of the thirteen men thought that the man was guilty but as more and more information was discovered by the man one man who though he was innocent, slowly the other jurors who once thought the man was guilty thought he was innocent. At the end of the movie the man was in fact innocent. If that one juror hadn't brought new information that was relevant to the case, they probably would've given the man a improper accusation.

This has resulted in a poor grade or a failed test. By having all the notes and assignments we need be easily accessible, students would not be worried about losing papers or have to constantly carry a giant binder with them. If students could access all their notes and assignments, they would get better grades and perform better in class as well.

62FC97D29846,"Conclusion.High school students must wake up quite early in the morning (typically before dawn), prepare for school, and drive through several minutes of traffic to arrive early: just to sit in various classrooms for ninety minutes at a time, completing classwork and receiving additional homework. How much more convenient it would be for some students to wake up whenever their body indicates it is adequately rested, get a healthy meal for breakfast, and work at their own pace in the comfort of their home. Such a relaxed schedule would be beneficial, especially for senior students in high school. Throughout the year, their minds are focused on completing college applications, applying for financial aid, sending in SAT scores and college transcripts. Taking online courses from home would allow those students to attend to their other responsibilities and manage classwork at their own convenience. In addition, some students, unfortunately, get bullied in school by their classmates. Studying at home would allow victims of bullying to be in their safe haven, away from those who oppress them and ridicule them for being different. Often times, high school students worry that colleges would view their decision to take online classes as lazy or careless, however, I have heard that colleges value how challenging the class is, the effort put in, and how well-rounded the student is.

She was so distracted by other things while she was doing her work, likewise, she never completed the work that she needed to get done and ended up not turning the work in. The summer going into her junior year she was depressed but also was very stressed. She ended up committing suicide and it was very hard for me as well as a lot of people to comprehend. A lot of students have a hard time with this task because you have to plan it out and go step by step through the process, but also giving your self enough extra time just in case you dont get it done within that period of time.

In classes such as math, it would be hard to teach the kids online when a subject such as that involves a lot of hands-on practice to fully understand the concepts. Because they are taking it online, there is no way for them to really get in contact with the teacher considering they may live many states away or even countries! How can you learn from your mistakes if you do not know what you are doing wrong and what you can do to fix it if you are unable to talk to the teacher about it in person.

You can even get advice on which classes to take next year or what sports you want to do or how you can convince your parents to let you do the sport that you want to do.

The best way to get better at sports is to seek advice from people who have played it for a long time.

Most sports like basketball or wrestling are just experience dominates.

In basketball if you are guarding someone with a lot of experience then it is going to be a lot harder because they already know the sport like the back of their hand.

It is always the best to seek advice from older players.

When they do online classes they will have a greater chance of missing less school and have easier access to making up work when they couldn't do school. ,3,0,67

73F69FA2E0E3,"Conclusion.School is a place where children go to learn and grow, not only intellectually, but also personally. I have many fond memories of creating long lasting relationships and discovering who I am as an individual. Most of this is due to the community aspect that school has. If I had been told that my education would be taught to me through the screen on a computer, ",4,2,67
73F69FA2E0E3,"Conclusion.These are all reasons why distance learning is not only a bad choice of education, but also that it can be harmful in the growth process of our youth. ",5,2,30
73F69FA2E0E3,"Conclusion.Communication is a large part of life. Perhaps you are being interviewed for a new job, or maybe you're giving a lecture at a Socratic seminar. Whatever the reason may be, social communication is a very important skill to have; and while this skill may come easy to some, for us introverts it can be a rather daunting task. As a child I was very shy and tended to cling towards my mother at any social event I would attend in order to avoid the other children. My mother never forced me to, so I saw nothing wrong with staying by her side instead as it is what I was comfortable with. It wasn't until my first year of grade school that I would be pushed into interacting with others without the sight of my mother. I had spent so many years avoiding others that I found it very difficult to be social with other kids. By the time Middle School came however, I had gotten quite use to being around other children and could present myself properly in a social space. However other students did not have that luxury. As the sixth grade started, I was introduced the first home schooled child I had ever seen. Due to her being home schooled, she didn't spend much time with other kids her own age. Because of this, she often didn't relate well to others and could never pick up on normal social ques. As the years went on and she continued to be taught in public school, she did in fact become a lot more social and gained a group of very close friends, myself included, but the point still stands that if either of us had stayed to ourselves and had never been put into a social environment at that young age, then we would've never learned how to properly conduct ourselves in society. ",3,2,316
73F69FA2E0E3,Conclusion.Being exposed to things allow students to grow a fondness for them and venture out of their comfort zone; something that distance learning is not able to do. ,0,2,29
73F69FA2E0E3,"Conclusion.However, simply because something can be done, does not mean it should be. ",6,0,14
73F69FA2E0E3,Conclusion.I've said how school has helped me develop long lasting relationship by putting my in a space where being social was somewhat mandatory. ,3,0,24
7443D525E32D,"Conclusion.If a student struggles to balance school, extra-curricular activities, and a job, they would probably find online classes to be very beneficial. When taking classes online, students are usually allowed for more freedom and flexibility. They can sleep in until noon, and then work on a class in the evening. Or if they work to help support their family, they can get up early, get their school work done, and work a job in the afternoon. Most online classes are scheduled similarly to college courses, and will allow students to plan when during the week they wish to take certain classes. My younger sister, who I spoke of earlier, has found this to be very beneficial, and something she will miss once she can fully reimmerse herself into a regular school schedule. ",3,2,133

Seeing the bigger picture allows you to see where a company or person might be getting their reasoning from when they make what seems to be a bad decision. When taking that extra info into consideration it allows you to understand the consequences of taking the other choice that might be more risky.

""Well I think you should get Cheese Factory Simulator, its got the same amount of reviews with 94% of them being positive, and it's $8 cheaper than Sauce Mixer 3!"" Generic_Name replied. Making a better choice can not only help you now, but it can also benefit you later when the price of the game might go up! Making a better choice can mean you have more of a certain resource to spare so you can donate extras to charity or some other organization.

7D5D980FD05F,"Conclusion.Students will also get a sense of who they are and what they like when engaging and developing relationships with other students, which students who take school online will not be able to do. Most students find joy in creating relationships with others, so they are excited to wake up every morning for school. Those who aren't able to create bonds with others may lack that motivation to get up every morning, which may take a toll on their mental health. ",3,2,82
7D5D980FD05F,"Conclusion.This is because the students who are enrolled in schools may look forward to getting out of the house and seeing their friends every morning, while the students who are enrolled in online schooling have to stay in, isolated from things beyond their household. This may cause harm on the mental health of the students taking school online because they may feel excluded from the world around them.

7E8238B5BA1C,Conclusion.Another reason why it would positively impact students to take online courses from the comfort of their homes is because there are less likely scenarios of a student missing their classes from any kind of emergency. ,0,2,37
7E8238B5BA1C,"Conclusion.Another person who illustrates why attending online courses prevents missing class for emergencies is from a situation my childhood friend Generic_Name had two years ago, when her older sister Generic_Name, who lived in Generic_City, got into a heavy car accident and Generic_Name and her single mother sponantiously made plans to go visit her since Generic_Name could not stay home alone. However, since Generic_Name had been taking her academic courses online, it did not make it hard for her to catch up on her work because all she really needed was a computer and there was no need for her to be in a physical classroom to participate.

81EB648B5B51,"Concluding Statement.Distance learning is a tool that should be utilized by schools only when student(s) are in dire need of time away from school. It should not be utilized as a replacement for school due to its ability to only teach independence, and hinder the collaboration capabilities along with social skills of students. Additionally, distance learning does not allow for students to receive hands on experience or access to laboratories. Despite being effective for short amounts of time, distance learning should not be implemented year round due to its ability to hinder the growth and learning of students and because of its lack of benefit to students not suffering from a mental illness or some form of sickness.  ",1,2,119

848CD0BA745D,"Conclusion.A typical classroom is made up of chairs, desks, a white or chalk board, and sometimes posters that are associated with the subject of a class. In addition, a majority of the classes prohibit the use of cellphones to ensure that a students focus on the academic work given to them. In a home, there would be a noticeable difference. Most homes have some kind of electronic devices such as televisions or radios which students would have unrestricted access to. The student would also have unrestricted access to their cellphone, since there wouldn't be a teacher present to stop them ",3,2,101
848CD0BA745D,"Conclusion.Now, there may be parental guidance present who could limit the amount of distractions ",2,2,15
848CD0BA745D,Conclusion.Another major issue that would rise from students being able to attend classes from home is the dependence of technology that would be needed to teach the kids. ,0,2,29

849228E9ADD8,"Conclusion.In the world, going to school is a daily task or ""job"" for students. Imagine not having the opportunity to get an education. Schools around the world can offer many different types of learing. Some schools in fact offer distance learning for students as an option to attend classes from home. ",4,2,52
84EC5D05E3E2,"Conclusion.Over 50 years, homeschooling has become an effective method of education. Not only are students allowed access to online learning while in the comfort of their own home, but they are also allowed to work in an independent, comforting environment. A student's environmental standards should be relevantly met in order to provide an adequate performance. Even high school juniors and seniors are provided with the opportunity to take online courses at home. ",3,2,73
84EC5D05E3E2,"Conclusion.But despite the minor distractions, students benefit from attending classes at home because they have options in managing their schedules, they are in a stress-reduced evironment, and because they do not have to endure obstacles as done in school. ",0,2,40
84EC5D05E3E2,"Conclusion.Aside from time management, students are strongly encouraged to strive and maintain their best efforts; although, this cannot be done in a stressful environment. Home may be considered a soothing, recapaliation location; whereas school is a stress induced setting, where sitting all day is tiring, lectures are given with no breaks, and students are uneasy. Classwork is given consequetively causing the brain to slow down its production. Meanwhile at home, students may choose their own pace to learn at and take breaks when needed. The stress at school not only reflects a negative environment, but it also affects the children and students from learning effectively. Based off my experience, I can declare that my mind flows better at home than it does in school. In English class I cannot seem to concetrate when writing the journals of the day. While at home, my thoughts flow like a stream. ",3,2,149
84EC5D05E3E2,"Conclusion.Waking up for school five days a week, at 5 a. m. is a challenge. Some teenagers, such as myself, are sleep deprived for righteous reasons: working late and completing homework or projects. Others have to do both, once in a while. But learning at home can give students an opportunity to get enough rest to get their work completed. Furthermore, some days at school are not spent learning. Instead, they are spent out of class because of school cancellations due to incliment weather, out-of-school suspensions, in-school-suspensions, or in the administrators office, getting disciplined for a violation of the dress code. Valuable instructional time is lost, whereas online education works around these obstacles. As a matter of fact, none of these factors are of importance when one is attending school from home. The minor, problematic situations at school are what make classes from home more beneficial. ",3,2,147

For example, if you do something wrong to your friend who trust in you, She or her is going to forgive you when you say sorry because, he or she trust in you. Being nice and respectful for example, not saying bad word to someone to be depressed, saying please when you are asking someone for something can also make someone trust in you. ",3,0,100
85004BC426B1,"Conclusion.Sometime when you are making new friends you dont just have to make friends, you have to think about it .

Make a friend who respect everyone, correct you when you do something wrong and someone who is there for you because, when something happen to and you have a bad friend, he or she will not help you but, If you have a good friend, he or she will help you when you are in a bad situation.

85F4C57672EA,"Concluding Statement.To conclude, students will realize that a teacher is way better than a computer. The teachers study the materials on what they gonna teach and they graduate from college, gain a diploma of what they teaching you.

When I was in sixth grade, I did a survey on whether or not people should keep fields to farmers, or sell the land to businesses and urbanize the land.

897004C788FB,"Conclusion.These different viewpoints could really effect your on view on a decision. Many people make poor choices because they are biased towards what they think is right. Most likely you will not get the same opinion and view on a situation over and over again. No matter how you look at it it's beneficial. Either you receive the same view over and over and it makes your decision very clear, or you get different viewpoints and a new way to look at the situation. ",3,0,85
897004C788FB,"Conclusion.With the help of trustworthy and honest peers, your decision is a lot more dependable. Hearing what others believe to be true tends to help. You have to remember to ask trustworthy people, and even then your decision may not be a good one. Even some of the smartest people in America, including our president, congress, and all of the houses ask for opinions from the people. Sure a few bad choices have been made, but I strongly feel the good heavily outweigh the bad. I also believe that the good outweigh the bad on even tiny decisions made day to day when you have multiple different perspectives. You can't go wrong with other people's help on choices no matter how big or small. ",3,2,125

Places like Sweden and Denmark show fantastic, flawless designs that allow students to properly use their time for both school and non-school activities. Our public schools, however, show many flaws that were enacted by generations in the past.

8BCB7962E7E3,Conclusion.The beauty behind this whole process is that online classes don't eliminate the ability to have face to face classroom interactions that students have today. ,6,2,26
8BCB7962E7E3,"Conclusion.Yes, online classes are meant to somewhat eliminate this factor, but in person interactions are also needed to have students grow. Hearts, the program mentioned above, has a system that has students meet their teachers in person once or twice a week. This allows teachers to show students real life applications with the information taught in class, as well as give students the ability to have social interaction with both teachers and other students. This allows the students to gain the pros of both online classing and the modern classroom interaction ",3,2,92

8C15FC3C3BCB,"Conclusion.In prison, solitary confinement is a punishment, so why make it an everyday thing as a free person? The best part about school for most, if not all, of us is our friends. For those with best friends, going a long time without them is a task. You don't have your laughing buddy and you miss them, even if you have other friends you couldnt be with. Most people feel sad when they don't have a friend to be with them in class and share the same struggles with when you fail or do bad. School is at least seventy-seven percent better when you have friends to go at it with. When you're in your room all day learning, that's no fun. School is required by the government and is already sad enough as it is. The only thing that personally keeps me going is my friends. Without them, I would have no will to do my work as they are the ones constantly telling me to do this and do that and don't procrastinate. Those friendly reminders are honestly what keep me from failing my classes. I couldn't name all the times I forgot to do an assignment and my friends were like, ""did you do so and so?"" And I would say, ""oh wow I completely forgot about that, thanks for reminding me,"" and would get started at lunch or in the morning. So if school were to be offered online, those reminders would fall through the cracks and I would have missing assignments left and right. ",3,2,262
8C15FC3C3BCB,"Concluding Statement.Some people say that taking school online or with video cameras is beneficial. However, they are incorrect because it would be easy to cheat and students would face isolation from their friends. Cheating would be readily available as you don't have the teachers eyes on you which makes it easier to cheat, no matter how honest a teenager says they are because we are impulsive beings who rarely think logically. Isolation would be a terrible added factor of online school as friends keep most of us going during the school day. ",1,2,93
8D2C20BDCDE0,Conclusion.Allowing students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing would be beneficial for students ,5,0,20
8D2C20BDCDE0,"Conclusion.Another example where distance learning is beneficial for students is when they have a family situation. A student might be out of school for a couple days due to a family situation and could fall behind on work. Being able to go to school online or video conference would help that student stay on track with work and not have to spend a week trying to catch up on missed work when they return to school. For example, I had a family member suddenly pass away a while ago, and I had to attend their funeral. As a result, I had to miss a couple of days of school and fell behind on a lot of work. Because it was so sudden, I couldn't plan ahead with my teachers and eventually was stressed out when I came back to school due to the amount of work I had. If online learning had been an option for me, I would've been able to stay on track in school and not have to deal with the stresses of catching up on missed work. ",3,2,182
8D2C20BDCDE0,"Conclusion.Online learning could also be implemented easily due to the fact that everyone has a chrome book in school, so many schools could install an app on the chrome book that allows for online learning to be possible. ",6,0,39
8D2C20BDCDE0,"Concluding Statement.Many students struggle during the school year because of missing school days, whether it's due to weather or due to a family situation, and distance learning would be a great option for those students to be able to stay on track with the school curriculum while missing school. Offering online learning will help a student continue their education, prevent them from falling behind in school, and create less stress for them to catch up on missed work; therefore, I think online learning would be beneficial for students and that schools should implement it into their systems.  ",1,2,98

8F8BCC081DC6,"Conclusion.Home schooling, also known as home education, is the education of children at home, it is usally conducted by a parent, tutor, or an online teacher. Many families use less formal ways of home school in North America, whereas ""home education"" is only used elsewhere. Before the introduction to compulsory, school attendance laws most education was done at home. Homeschooling can affect social life. Attending public schools all your life you know a lot of people. So I think homeschooling can cause depression or cause anybody who tries home education to be lonely. ",4,0,94
8F8BCC081DC6,Conclusion.In other nations home schooling is illegal so students have no choice but to attend public or private schools. In the legal states students can be home schooling for many reasons. Some reasons can be like parents not wanting their kids around others while learning. Other reasons can be dealing with being kicked out of school and no other schools will accept you because of behavior. In my society today I know a few people that have been kicked out school and forced to be home schooled online. ,3,0,89

94DF4BBF522F,Conclusion.An example is the thinking difference between children and adults. How children thinks aren't that mature yet but they can probably think quicker but less effective. Adults could think much slower but overall make the wiser decisions. This can impact advice giving and getting all kinds of point of views can help you sort out your thoughts and make the overall best decision for yourself on your own problem more than getting one piece of advice and doing the wrong thing for yourself. ,3,0,84
952CB87D4897,"Conclusion.Asking someone a simple question like ""Is this good to go?"" can truly impact someone's mindset of how to deal with problems, and can give them strong advice of how to handle the problem they currently have. Multiple pieces of advise would make an even bigger impact on a person and give them more understanding of what others think. Because of this they will be more prepared, and have a different mentality for future problems. From my personal experience, I can relate to having others critic and check my work because I know the helpfulness and understanding I get, can make a real impact on me. ",3,2,108
952CB87D4897,"Conclusion.
It has been proven that stress only causes harmful and emotional side effects to individuals. So, why not remove it? That is exactly why simple checks on your work, or something you may be unsure about can make a real impact. As stressful as everyday human lives can be, there's no harm done in taking a little out of your time to ask others about your situation and how to deal with it. Being more sure on something can cause an individual to worry less and end up making better decisions. Maybe you have a huge decision coming up like a proposal. You need to be absolutely sure and know it in your gut that this is the right decision to be made, and asking others can help you know that you are making the right decision or you are making the wrong decision ",3,2,145
952CB87D4897,"Conclusion.Also, as modern day society is getting bigger and bigger, and people are becoming more reliant on safety, it is extremely important to ensure and provide safety for each individual, and asking for other's advice can ensure you that your decision is safe and responsible.

9627B47C10DE,"Conclusion.For instance, in Generic_Name's situation she asked three of her friends what to do about her toxic friend Generic_Name. Two of her friends told her bad things about Generic_Name and gave Generic_Name more reasons to stop being her friend, whereas only one of her friends told her to keep being Generic_Name's friend. Since more people reacted the same way to the situation, Generic_Name now had a more informed opinion and a better idea of what to do. ",3,2,78
9627B47C10DE,Conclusion.Another example is if you want to start a business selling jars filled with dirt and you ask your friends if you should. Your friends could give you different reactions to the idea. Four of them could say that it's a terrible business idea and two of them could tell you to go for it. Since more people felt that it was a bad idea you could rethink it and make a better decision in the end. ,3,2,78
97A6E516249D,"Conclusion.While the internet can be used in very useful and academic ways, there are also a plethora of ways to get sidetracked. Things like social media platforms and Netflix will always be there taunting the student, requiring a substantial amount of willpower to not give into these deep dark holes of mindless entertainment. If it is already hard enough for students to focus in classrooms with a physical adult present giving instructions, just think how much harder it will be to focus without any of these accomodations (plus the addition of having the freedom to wear pajamas and move at their own pace). Not only will they have other platforms distracting them, but they will also have to make sure they are staying on track and not pushing things off to the last minute ",3,2,135
97A6E516249D,"Conclusion.Lastly, distance learning makes students miss out on so many activities that come with going to a physical school. ",0,2,20
97A6E516249D,"Conclusion.School spirit and pep rallies, sports, and questionable cafeteria food are just a handful of these experiences. The American middle school and high school experience has been romanticized in countless movies and TV shows, and many do not wish to miss out on that. Even if good or bad experiences occur in a physical school, most adults look fondly upon their high school years as a learning experience and a time to have fun. Real friends and relationships blossom from having physcial interactions with each other, not sitting behind a screen. Distance learning can cause a student who is not a social butterfly to stay in isolation at their house, thus creating a breeding ground for mental illness. Going to a school in the presence of physical people is much simpler and benefits a child much more in regards to social interactions and access to activities. Online learning will cause students to miss out on great experiences; therefore, distance learning is not beneficial for students. ",3,2,166

97A6E516249D,"Concluding Statement.Procrastination is a word that teenagers are familiar with, and online learning creates an enviroment where it is too easy to push work back until the last minute. While students can push work back, they also have the constant ability to access their classes, putting excessive stress on a student and destroying their mental health. In addition, students will not be able to have the traditional American school experience they learn online. Even though we are moving into a new age where technology is heavily emphasized, sometimes it is best to stick with the traditional way.  ",1,2,98
97E7DD4E7C69,"Conclusion.''Hey, should I wear this or this tomorrow?'' I'm sure we've all had a friend ask us our opinion's on something, like what to wear on the first day of school, but ever wonder why they go and ask others on their perspective as well? ",4,2,47
97E7DD4E7C69,"Concluding Statement.To conclude this entire essay, When someone is asking for advice or opinions about something they are just trying to keep an open mind are trying to make the right decision that they wont regret later in their life.

A0448AC8783F,"Conclusion.Everyone has lived a different life, whether you were rich or poor, healthy or ill, no one has lived the same life as another. When you need help making a choice, you talk to people because they haven't lived exactly like you. They haven't lived exactly like anyone. I would need to know what other people have spectated or experienced when they have had to make a choice similar to mine because I don't want one person to help. I want more people to help advise me because they might have experienced more than I have. You get more wisdom to make your choice when you hear more experiences.

A2A749DEC4BE,"Conclusion.As a consultant that helps other students with writing, I see many strange things from people with half finished essays. The one that grabs the trophy, however, was incredibly ridiculous. At the beggining of a students work, they talked about how Abraham Lincoln and George Washington had a conversation. Not only did it have nothing to do with their central theme of Lincoln being the best president, but I gaurentee you they did not have multiple people help review their work. We did get them the help they needed, and through multiple peoples advice, it was transformed into a pretty good persuasive essay. When searching for help, whether it's with editing a school paper, or understanding concepts that are confusing for you in a difficulty subject, it's always important to look for more than one opinion. If you were to only ask a singe individual, their response could be flawed for many, many reasons ",4,2,155
A2A749DEC4BE,"Conclusion.For example, if you needed to write an unbiased paper on the pros and cons of making abortion legal, asking more than one person would limit the scope of the bias. If you only asked one individual, their statements could be tainted if they had a preexisting opinion on the topic ",3,0,52
A2A749DEC4BE,"Conclusion.When asking people for advice, you must always consider whether what they're saying is actually true. ",0,2,17
A2A749DEC4BE,"Conclusion.Bias is incredibly important to weed out, but often fact checks can also help root out some bias too. Biased individuals are more likely to lie or include misleading statements in their advice. By discovering false or misleading statements, you can also discover hidden bias in the individual. None of us are always right, so people have mistaken opinions about many topics. When looking for help, you always run the risk of including false information from a well meaning individual, as you have nobody to fact check them against. You have no way to tell if what they're saying is true, and, if they deliver it more confidently, you may already be convinced it's a fact. Luckily, when you ask multiple people, and fact check all of their statements against one another, you can assure yourself a significantly smaller chance of obtaining false information. Although fact checking against other people can certainly help, there are other ways, including searching on Google or looking it up with a textbook, to fact check correctly. However, some statements are simply opinions and cannot be fact checked, only compared to other people's opinions. ",3,2,190
A2A749DEC4BE,"Concluding Statement.Asking multiple people for advice, no mater the topic, is always an important and crucial step of the writing process. By asking multiple people, you assure the least bias possible, the highest form of fact checking, the best way to phrase sentences and other similar opinionated subjects, and you ensure none of those you seek advice from made mistakes.  ",1,2,61

When a different understanding is taken place, the person who has the problem can visualize the ending result, as one of my friend said to me over a discussion. When he a found a different understanding of the problem, he concluded that it helped him find a shortcut to a solution, and it helped him visualize the problem in a way that helped him find a way to solve the problem. Different understandings can make a person feel that there are easier and less stressful ways to solve a problem, they can understand how the problem was caused, and how to find a way to solve it. This briefly ties in with the person making a better choice about the problem linking to a different understanding because it helps the person really figure out how it can be solved, which could be finding one solution, or multiple solutions that can help the person understand what there dealing with and how they can solve the problem without having to panic that one solution could lead to bad things that could negatively impact there life, but with a different understanding of the problem, it can help the person make a better choice to the problem, and find an easy solution that doesn't do any harm to the persons life.

So when Beyonce heard that my sister needed to go dress shopping she was more then happy to come along. Her job was to help my sister pick out the dresses to try on and then give her opinion. Her way of giving her opinion was just to first point out all the things she liked about the dress and then something that my sister maybe want to consider.

Say you and a friend get involved in an argument and you aren't sure how to handle it. You ask some friends what to do. They explain that your friend is having a bad day and some family issues at home. Rather than be upset with your friend, you decide to do everything in your power to help your friend out. Hearing other angles or sides of a story changes the way we view an issue or person, therefore plays a key role in the making of that decision or series of decisions. ",3,2,111
AFF882607973,"Concluding Statement.asking multiple people for advice is more efficient that asking only one. Hearing several opinions allows for neutral, unbiased advice. Receiving advice from several friends, teachers, peers, or family members can play a rather important role on our thought process on a given topic in a positive way. And viewing all sides of a story, instead of just our own, can allow for better, more beneficial choices to be made. ",1,2,72

B0C3BBF86B9B,"Conclusion.In many situations, judgment can easily be corrupted. This can be caused by stress, deficient energy, or maybe just a busy schedule. With a corrupted field of judgment, decisions cannot be made with complete logic. In less then two minutes, someone's life can be changed. That is all it takes for a good or bad decision to be made. A great example is speeding up to a yellow traffic light rather than slowing down. There is a risk of crashing or getting pulled over, but also getting to the destination faster. The right decision may lead to a beneficial addition to the day. However, the wrong decision may lead to something grave. When making a decision, advice is a great way to try and stay on the right path ",3,2,130

BA881F8A8909,"Conclusion.Many students choose to participate in traditional and online schooling.

Online schooling can include video conferencing with teacher or enrollment in a class taken on the computer.

Giving students the ability to take classes from home is a widely debated topic. ",4,0,42
BA881F8A8909,"Conclusion.In order to graduate at many public and private schools, students must meet graduation requirements.

There are multiple classes a student must take to graduate that are electives.

These classes take up space in kid's schedules restricting the amount of core classes a student can take.

If schools allow these kids to take these classes in their free time, students will be able to complete these courses and move onto classes they will use in the future.

For example, all school require students to partake in a health class throughout their high school careers.

If students are capable of taking this class in the summer rather than in the school year, a new gap in their schedule opens for another class.

Also, online schools prevent advance students from burning out.

Many children who were placed in advanced learning at a young age experience a burn out.

This occurs when the student does not have to work as hard in their education as others.

This produces a poor work ethic, which is essential in the real world.

By allowing these students to take an extra course online, they will be challenged forcing them to improve their work ethic and time management.

Online school gives students a chance to get ahead in their education

BEE54D4D2B79,"Conclusion.When someone seeks advice, they should ask multiple people because it ensures them that their choice will be least biased. People should avoid bias because some opinions may not benefit them and may only benefit the person who is giving the piece of advice. When people ask for advice, each person they ask most likely has a different opinion. When all these opinions are considered, the chance of bias is reduced. When someone takes their own advice, they may have a slight inclination to go for what they want to do, and they may not consider all options. For example, I have a decision to make of whether or not I want to move for my father's work to Generic_City. I only considered my own preferences for a while, and I automatically said that I didn't want to go. I refused to leave my friends, my school, my routine, and everything else that makes my life splendid here. When I finally decided to hear what my parents had to say, my choice became less biased. My parents helped me see the benefits of moving, which I had not thought about because I didn't want to think that I would enjoy moving. In addition they helped me see it in their point of view, which leads to the next point. ",3,2,220

BF3CC3305C55,"Conclusion.At the University of Utah a survey went around asking students if they made better choice when they asked more people for advice or if they made a better choice when they asked one person for advice 70.2% said they made a better choice when asking more people compared to the 29.8% that claimed they made a better choice when asking one person. However, majority claimed the best outcome would be asking just more than one person, still a lot of students replied just one person. From past experiences asking one person can make you think that that option and only that option will be the best, when in reality its actually not. When asking for advice you need someone who gives their opinion on what hey would do, not try to snatch away your judgment and brainwash you to their opinion. ",3,2,145
BF3CC3305C55,"Concluding Statement.asking more people for their opinion can not only help you build trust with the people you ask, but help you learn more about them and their experiences and make the best choice. So in the future it is much recommended that you seek more than just one persons opinion on a situation your not so sure about.  ",1,2,60

This means a lot because the first opinion might not always be the best one for you. So go and get that second,third or maybe fourth opinion it won't hurt it will only help and you have many different people with different experiences in there life to help you. For example you could ask someone who dose not have much experience in what your asking but then if you get a second opinion they could help you because maybe they have had experience with it sometime in there life. So if you would have just got the one opinion it might not have turned out good as it would if you got that second opinion. So just getting one opinion may not be the best choice. ",3,2,162
C2A6C69714EC,Conclusion.When athletes get injured they get an opinion from the doctor if they think they should get surgery or whatever and most of them go to other doctors for more opinions to find there best option. This helps them a lot because some doctors could say they need surgery but then others they go to could say that they won't need surgery and that they just need rest or physical therapy or something. sometimes the doctors will even say they might need career ending surgery but another doctor says that he can still play after a surgery he just need to recover. As you can expect that other opinion helps big time for them so they won't have to possibly end there career. Or it could be the other way around that one doctor says he dose not need surgery but other doctors do then he should go with surgery so whatever is hurting does not get worse and force him to stop playing. For example a couple of weeks ago there was this pitcher in baseball that got injured and was going to doctors to see if he was okay one doctor said he would need Tommy John surgery which usually puts you out for a whole season and he didn't want that so he went to two other doctors who both said he wouldn't need it so that saved him from missing a entire season which helps him a lot. ,3,2,243
C2A6C69714EC,"Concluding Statement.Now

I will conclude my reasons on why people should seek multiple opinions to help them later on. So as you can tell after reading this finding more opinions is very helpful and could change your life in some ways. However this does not mean that every first opinion you get is wrong it just means that it dose not hurt to have multiple opinions to choose from. Like I said in sports and In basically anything in life it helps because you will always have choices to make and getting more opinions might just come up big for you. After going over my essay of why you should get multiple opinions then I hope you consider seeking more than one opinion next time you need an opinion on something.     ",1,2,132

When I was asking for advice on how I should sell my stuff, most of my friends told me to sell the so that I could make as much money as possible. when I asked my teacher for advice on how I should sell them, she told me that I should not sell them at all. she told me that I should donate it to a charity that she works for in her free time. she told me about the organization and how it gives back to kids that are less fortunate and can't afford clothes like us.

C816339C4D91,"Conclusion.One's house will most often contain most of their sources of entertainment, such as video games, food, hobbies, electronic devices, and more. As children with developing brains, staying on task with all of these factors can only be accomplished by a few, but not the majority. A study conducted by the University of Virginia states that, ""almost 90% of students under the age of 18 have an attention span of about 10-30 minutes before becoming distracted"" (Generic_Name). This exemplifies how most students cannot stay focused in a video based classroom when there is no adult supervisor or teacher directly making sure they listen, which is quite difficult to achieve via distance learning. With this in mind, it is harder for students to have motivation to complete work during class time when they have easy access to other sources of entertainment right at their fingertips. Thus, video based learning is detrimental to student's work ethic because it gives them no motivation to complete their work whereas in the normal school system, they would be forced to work on it during class because of a direct presence of an adult supervisor keeping them on track. All in all, a world without video learning for all students is a one that strengthen's one's work ethic through practice in the work place rather than at home. ",3,2,223

Obviously, these students are at much less risk of losing their understanding of the material, but absences still require make-up work. Students can miss lessons and lectures, project presentations, and critical study time with their peers that would better their understanding. With distance learning, a student who is well enough to work but contagious to their peers could still present a project, take a test, take notes on a lecture, and engage in class discussions all from home. It is unfair to limit a student's potential learning time based on things that they cannot control, like illnesses or travel. Furthermore, students that travel frequently would also be benefited, as they could work while on the go and review material when they have free time so as not to fall so far behind their classmates.

D7B12358DBA3,"Conclusion.Because classes are taken online, the teacher or instructor utilizes different technological tools and resources for lesson plan and activities. It broadens the possibilities of how information can be delivered to students and the different class work students can participate in. Online classes can also seem a more appealing option to in person classes, as lessons and assignments tend to be more direct and straight forward. Often times, school teachers give ""fluff"" assignments that don't necessarily have a purpose or that don't offer much learning potential. These assignments are given to pass time and give students an activity to do whether in class or for homework. I have endured my share of ""fluff"" assignments throughout high school. During my sophomore year, I despised English class because I didn't seem to gain anything out of it. My teacher would assign miscellaneous assignments such as a food poem or a repetitive packet of work. Online classes tend to include less of these ""fluff"" assignments because they differ from traditional in person classes where students meet personally with teachers. There is less of a worry to keep students occupied with different assignments each class. With the Generic_School Online Campus, students are given assignments to complete each week with the due date at the end of that week. Teachers tend to give less unnecessary assignments because the class can be more spread out throughout the course. ",3,2,233

DBCC1F8F92B5,"Conclusion.In sixth grade, I was student council president of my school, and one of the topics many students wanted me to address was on bullying. I didn't know how exactly I could help students going through this horrible ordeal, because many victims of bullying don't like to stand up for fear of more shame. When I consulted with teachers, students, and my parents, they all had an overarching idea of focusing on kindness and the prevention of bullying, instead of bullying itself. This was something I never thought of before and never would have been able to think of, but with the aid of many others, I was able to form a new idea for approaching bullying in my school. I established a wristband kindness program, where wristbands were given out to students who were seen doing kind acts, such as helping another student without being asked or holding the door open at recess. When those students saw another student doing a thoughtful deed, they would pass on the bracelet and continue the spread of kindness. This motivated many young children to become more generous and understanding, a trait that will take them far in life. This idea wouldn't have even have been possible if it weren't for all the kids and teachers that helped me decide what I should focus on as student council president, as well as giving me the ideas for the project. I was able to develop a more inclusive program from multiple opinions, which also helps provide different viewpoints in conflicts. ",3,2,257

DE2A70D1284E,"Conclusion.When seeking advice from others, we likely already have a favored position on the topic. Sometimes, we search for reassurance and not advice. However, questioning others about our situations is better for the outcome of the experience because it brings us new perspectives. Perspective can be key to finding the solution to a problem because it allows one to look at the problem as a whole, and not just from a biased position. When blinded by a biased perspective, we force ourselves to ignore different outlooks on the situation. It is when we remove that toxic blindfold that we realize whether we are truly in the wrong or what is the true source of the conflict.

E33ACC2CE4A9,"Conclusion.For example, say you need advice on whether or not to get a dog or a cat as a pet. What would happen if you did seek advice? What would happen if you didn't? What kind of opinions would you become aware of?

You are unsure whether a dog or cat is a right pet for you. You decide to ask the advice from multiple others by different sources. One person you ask is completely against dogs; this person is being biased as they are telling you how they believe cats are better than dogs, only because they have one. They list the negative qualities of dogs, and list the positive qualities of cats, something you consider.

The same thing in the above paragraph happens with a dog lover, who advises you get a dog, which in their opinion, is better than a cat. This person has a dog, and is being biased aswell. This enables you to get different opinions on your question by seeing both sides of the story. The dog lover, like the cat lover, now tells you the negative qualities of cats, then the positive qualities of dogs. You can now make a better choice on which pet to get that suits you.

Now, say you didn't ask for any other opinion and decide to get a dog. Since you didn't seek out others advice, you find that this dog needs too much exercise, is always hungry, and doesn't leave you alone.

F3C003AF7423,"Conclusion.A great example of this is when my friend Generic_Name got in a fight once. He got sent to the office and was claiming he didn't start it and it was self defense, so they called in a few people who saw what had happened and found out Generic_Name was telling the truth. This is important because if you only ask one person they can use their bias opinion to make a person or situation seem better or worse than it actually was. Another example is in football when there is a call being made all the refs huddle up to talk about their opinions on what happened during the play. This highlights the fact that when there are multiple opinions the out come is usually better and more logical. ",3,2,131

I had the similar thing happen to me when I was dating someone because I didn't have any ideas for a date, so when I asked my friends I had much better and more ideas. All the ideas were helpful and useful and made my date worth while. ",3,2,142

F54BD89B665A,"Conclusion.being separated from a learning environment makes it more difficult to complete work and focus, ",0,2,16
F54BD89B665A,"Conclusion.Take for example, completing an online course. When students are at home taking the online course, they are placed in a more comfortable environment that lacks a working ambiance. Consequently, there is a greater chance that the student could focus their attention away from the work because of distractions that may include: television, chores, video games, and others. They may also more easily have the tendency to slack off and fall behind. While completing work at a school, students are surrounded by materials that place them in the mindset of their education, and provided help and support that encourages learning and success, rather than the at home comforts. Fortunately, at school there are a limited number of things that will focus ones attention away from what is needed to be completed, and done to the fullest potential with effort. In a working environment the encouragement to learn not only comes from the instructors, but also the other students that also attend the school. ",3,2,164

F93D06BC99D8,Conclusion.Seeking multiple opinions when you are making a decision helps you make a better choice ,5,0,16
F93D06BC99D8,"Conclusion.For many decisions, you don't need advice of your peers, but some do, and it is best for those that you get more than one opinion. Studies have shown, that the more sources you have, the more likely you are to make a correct decision, and likewise, the less sources you have, the weaker your decision will be. When you have more people's opinions, you have a higher chance of finding the general consensus and making the correct decision. By mathematics and by logic, you should be able to find correct advice if you have more opinions and beliefs. ",3,2,100
F93D06BC99D8,"Concluding Statement.Generic_Name found out much later that she made the wrong decision about the Spring break vacation. While her family was on vacation, she learned that there was a Martian Flu outbreak at her office and she will not be able to work along with her husband, who was recently fired.

When Generic_Name made the decision, she should have known that many of her coworkers had Martian Flu and that it was starting to spread when she planned the vacation. She lost two paychecks and they had to live on savings for a few months until they ran out of savings. Generic_Name's husband got a loan from the bank and they barely had enough food to survive, but Generic_Name learned her lesson. This lesson was when making a major decision, you should seek multiple opinions before you make the final decision. When people make a decision, they sometimes don't get a second or third opinion, and they make a poor choice. If only these people were able to make a better decision and be given more. Had they asked more people for advice, they would be able to see that they were wrong and that the other people were correct. In order to make a correct decision, you need to seek advice and this helps you by giving you more points of view, gives you a higher chance of finding correct advice, and puts math on your side. So next time you need advice, ask multiple people their decision, this will drastically improve the outcome of your decision. ",1,2,259

FEF42864AE28,"Conclusion.A significant problem in schools today, is students getting behind the pace of the class and having to rush in order to catch up. This leads to them not fully grasping the full understanding of what's being taught. Students will also tend to produce sloppier work when rushing and getting a worse grade than they could have. Home school however, does not have this problem as students can go at their own pace whether its fast or slow. This helps students get the grades they deserve instead of rushing and having them not produce their best effort. Having home schooled students work at their own pace also creates beneficial work habits due to them actually doing the full amount of work. If students are not completing the required amount of work or more, than they may start to think that it's appropriate to only give half of their best effort instead of putting the full amount of work in for an assignment.

FEF42864AE28,"Concluding Statement.Technology is a major factor in our world today as it has both positives and negatives. It has also brought major change into the education system as now students may have an option to learn online instead of the traditional classroom. While online learning is new to education, it has also brought up the argument about whether it's more or less beneficial than regular school. Unfortunately, common problems arise with online learning that effect the young and future generations of our society. Taking classes from home may allow students to work at their own pace, but due to distractions at home and the decrease of social interaction, home schooling is less beneficial than going to regular school.  ",1,2,119
