023CEE52C08C,"Conclusion.In the begining of the artical it talks abou how Venus isthe second closest planet from the sun and how it is one of the two most similar planets to Earth. Since it has similarities to Earths' size and density scientest have sentunmanded spacecrafts to Venus to investigate.

Unfortunatlly no space craft has survived acording to the last two sentances of paragraph two. In the beginning of paragraph three it states how a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide engulfs Venus. The clouds on this planet are also highly currosive with sulfuric acid in them. The planets surface averages about 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric presure is 90 times greater than on Earth. This concludes that Venus has the hotest surface tempreature of any planet in our solar system.

04147BBED91A,"Conclusion.Technology has been upgraded throughout recent decades, and most recently, technology has taken a different approach. The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe. Dr. Huang and his colleagues are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate, but is this really a better way to communicate? It comes down to the facts. The computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. Everyone has different ways of expressing emotions, and not everyone feels the same emotions. Thinking that a computer could possibly detect your emotions is a bit silly, to some, and valuable to others. So what makes it silly to some? You can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the look on their face, you can talk with them in person. ",3,0,148

0821EB1AEDED,"Conclusion.When teachers assign projects that are related to the class, it is reasonable because it help us understand the subject more, but when they assign a regular project, especially one over summer break, it is often a misguided project on what they think students want to learn but does not really aid them. Giving the chance for a student to do something they want to learn about, will get them more engaged and give them their ideal way of learning. They would not have to worry about what teachers think they should learn but rather what they want to learn and will aid them in the future. Students who do a project about what they want to learn will make doing a project like that more enjoyable over a summer break rather than a set learning experience. They will gather more information to aid them in what they want to do, instead of being given something they think they should do, this will make the learning experience way beneficial for them and not waste their time in the long run. They can continue to learn educational information for them and gain more knowledge that matches their learning style and will satisfy what they have learned. Therefore, students would have a better learning experience if they could do projects their own way and had design freedom and not be held down by a set learning path.

Telling a force one a real smile can be que trickey but a computer can tell the differences. ,1,1,55
0BDD43321AFD,"Conclusion.Student-designed projects could focus on what students question or wonder about in their day to day lives, peaking their interests and making the task feel more fun and creative. Students could receive a broad outline like 'write an essay' or 'create a display', and turn it into a unique piece that expresses themselves; something like a paper on endangered animals. ",0,2,61
0BDD43321AFD,"Conclusion.During summer a lot of trips and vacations are taken whether with family or friends, near or far. Nevertheless, each one requires people to leave their homes and travel with the minimal amount necessary to save space. In my experience, I once was gone for almost the entire summer. One week I was in Pennsylvania with my relatives and the next I was swimming in the crystal clear waters of the Bahamas. Now imagine if these vacations, no matter how long the duration, were to be taken away from students because of a teacher-designed, summer project. If one was to receiveÂ a project of this type, there is no way of telling how much time or the location required to get it done. For example, if teachers were to design a summer research paper on the history of where you live, it might be necessary to go to the public library to view history records. No one can do that or go there if they're skiing all the way in Colorado. ",3,2,172
0BDD43321AFD,"Conclusion.Some, especially teachers, might argue that having students design their own summer projects will lead to the minimal work necessary and a poorly done assignment. Teachers might say that students are primarily focused on their summers and just having fun, rather than getting something done that could benefit them in their next school yea ",2,2,55

0BF9F64D6FD1,"Conclusion.Some of the most successful people are regarded for their fame and success due to self exploration. In Benjamin Franklin's famous autobiography, he shares his experiences through self exploration. Growing up in a poor household, Franklin's father could not afford to send him to a traditional college education, but through Franklin's own personal endeavors and exploration, he became one of America's founding fathers, discovered lightning, and paved a legacy that is still remembered today. Simple self exploration can start with these summer projects. When a student is given their own freedom, remarkable results can follow. The purpose of a curriculum is to mend our future minds into strong, independent thinkers, so by implementing simple strides of self exploration, schools and teachers are able to mold the minds of successful students. In my own experiences, self exploration has made a remarkable impact. When I was 15 I started my first company, learning everything on my own with the help of a few mentors along the way. Not only did I grow as a person, but my knowledge for business also grew tremendously. Through the use of online resources, videos, and contacts, I was able to produce something I am truly proud of. The work I put in, was time I wanted to because I was truly passionate about what I was doing. That passion is what we need to strive for. From simple opportunities for self exploration during the summer to long term projects, as a society we need to move towards encouraging self education and self exploration. ",3,2,258

Someone could be the next Albert Einstein and focus on school so much that he didn't have time for extracurricular activities, but you decide to hold him back because of a silly little thing he didn't do. Whether students do extracurricular activities or not shouldn't determine if they proceed to learn new things. The administrators should look at their grades and their work habits.

Some students even do multiple sports and still balance that with school. So for them to try and balance their after school activities, school, and now an extracurricular activity, it would be chaos. Students already go through enough stress with peer pressure, and their grades, and maybe just problems at home, so they shouldn't have to worry about this too. For example, maybe some students want to get a scholarship through playing a sport,and maybe their really good and actually have a chance at getting one.

1155F7A18D6C,"Conclusion.Venus is closest to earth, and earth has a twin. The differences between mars and venus is that sometimes we are esloser to mars and sometimes we are colser to venus, because venus is sometimes around the corner in space and human are sent to numerous spacecraft. No spacesraft has survived more than a few hours not a single spaceship has touched down on venus's more than three decades. When the spacesship trys to land it can't because venus is almost 97 percent caron dioxide blankets venus and the most challenging is that venus have clouds that are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venuss atmosphere. Venus temperatures average is over 800 degrees fahenheit. Not many people has land on venus because how hot the planet is and if they are up thirty plus miles above the surface it's still going to be toasty at around 170 degrees. The most importsntly, researchers cannot take samples of rock gas, or anything elae from a distance. The scientists to see the conduct to thorough mission is to understand venus they need to get close and personal despite the risks. A old technology called mechanical computers the devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and it played an important role in 1940s during the world war 2. It's danger to be on venus it's so hot we won't survived by trying to land on it it's 800 degrees on the planet. Venus might be the second to the sun but mercury is closer to our sun and venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, but merury is closer to the sun.

1497D777FE12,Conclusion.Some could argue that it is more beneficial for students to design summer projects because students can make them more enjoyable. ,2,2,22
1497D777FE12,"Conclusion.For example, if there was a summer project for a chemistry class, the teacher would want to develop it so that it relates to the upcoming curriculum and provides a good introduction for the year. So, perhaps the teacher would assign work on the basic topics of chemistry, namely what an atom is and what the parts are, the periodic table, nomenclature, and simple chemical reactions. By doing so, students begin the school year with knowledge that can allow them to grasp the later curriculum with more speed and ease. Summer projects are perfect for setting the foundation for the school year, laying the ground upon which the building of knowledge can rise. Teachers are the only ones who can create the most efficient and effective summer projects to maximize their students success, considering they know the material like the back of their hand and they are the ones who are teaching it. ",3,2,154
1497D777FE12,"Conclusion.It can be a shock, for some students, starting the school year blindly without any hints as to how the teacher is going to relay the curriculum to them. For example, one teacher may enjoy using textbooks to teach the subject, so he or she might assign pages to read or even a problem set for the summer. On the other hand, a teacher may prefer lectures, hands on learning, or visual learning. A summer project could match the teachers style of teaching, providing a proper introduction to the school year. Therefore, only teachers themselves can create a summer project that is successful in reflecting their personal style of teaching. This allows the students to know what to expect when starting the new year, and can lead to more success, more confidence, and less anxiety about staring anew with a teacher. ",3,2,142
14A542270754,"Conclusion.Some people say summer projects have to support the student for the rigor of the following school year, and that student designed projects will not demand the same skills needed to prepare them for the next year.

200AA7A37060,"Conclusion.Most teacher designed projects rely on specific structures and check list drawn up by the teacher for the students to fallow. They do no prompt the students to: think, learn, ponder, and reflect, rather they give studentsÂ a list of mundane tasks to complete and check off. Critical thinking and complex learning comes from hands on practice thought and refection. Giving a student a complex prompt or problem and allowing them to design the project themselves in order to answer it, stimulates the brain far more than handing the student an assignment where the answers have already been neatly planed and laid out by the teacher. For a better education students need to be able to solve problems on their own and chart their own waters, they will never grow if they are always defendant on a teacher to tell them what to do and how to do it.

2017D32A0639,"Conclusion.The point of a summer assignment is to prevent to student from losing knowledge or getting rusty because of a break. Although the point of the summer break is to let students relax until the next year starts, it's still important that they keep their studies up. Assignments shouldn'Â be student-designed because that would allow too much leisure and when school comes around, most students would not have it done. For example, I had two summer assignments last summer. One was for English and one was for Math. For the English one, the assignment was to read any book of my choosing and write a review about it. This assignment had very unclear instructions and I, the student, was supposed to add my own twist to it and complete the assignment however I wanted to. I started on the assignment, but never finished it because I didn't have the motive since there was no specific prompt to answer to, so I wrote a couple of sentences and called it quits. But for the Math assignment, I had a packet to complete of practice problems. The finish was in sight and crystal clear. I did it throughout the summer and finished it by August. The reassurance I felt that once I did a specific amount of work and followed the teacher's directions, I would be done is what encouraged me to finish. The English assignment was unclear and I didn't know how much to complete to make sure that I was on track for next year. ",3,2,256
20897B41AFB8,"Conclusion.Aside from the mental, physical, and financial sides of the argument there is also the legal side of it.

20C01368FC3E,Conclusion.Summer projects should be student-designed ,5,0,6
20C01368FC3E,"Conclusion.The one thing students ask of the most would be a laid back summer. Because of all the stress they endure during the year, students want a bit of time to reflect and relax. If students make their own projects they could make it very simple. Most may think of that as taking a shortcut through life, but in reality they do enough work as it is in school. If teachers made the projects, chances are they'd want to challenge the students a lot. When projects are teacher-designed students are less likely to complete it. To add on students wouldn't want to ruin their schedule with a boring project that their teacher designed; they'd want their project to be less time consuming during break. ",3,2,125
20D81D1BE1A6,"Conclusion.Yes, the use of Facial Action Codying Stystem would be very useful for students in the classroom. ",5,2,18
20D81D1BE1A6,"Conclusion.Not only can this technology detect when a student is confused or bored, but it can change the lesson to grab the students' attention again, or to explain it in an another way. ",0,2,34

20D81D1BE1A6,"Conclusion.This can greatly change a students grades from bad to good, along with make them look forward to coming to your class or school in general. From paragraph 6 the author stated, ""A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Ending the conversation with, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor."" Another point which dosn't relate to the fact of changing around lessons for a student would be also in paragraph 6,""...if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow.

20D81D1BE1A6,"Conclusion.We can learn about our human bodies and why emotion is displayed so easily, and how it's displayed as well. ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" Our faces can move in multiple ways depending on the emotion we feel, as shown in paragraphs 7-8. Why does it do this?

While 30 miles is a long way abover the planet, the temperature would still be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, which is not ideal for reseachers. ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" If studying a planet is as difficult as the author is saying here, then Venus should be abandoned because even if NASA was able to study it, there is obviously no way that the planet will ever be suitable to live on. The author's arguments so far have all been a lost cause. ",3,2,109

211C17AD0F75,"Conclusion.The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. If your in a classroom and you don't have one of those (FACS) then one day a student can come in all calm in the from out of nowhere there's a fight. But with a FACS when that person comes in the room, and the computer scans the person and it shows that the person is angry. Now that the teacher knows that the person is angry an they can see if they can calm them down. In paragraph 6 it's says ""a classroom coomputer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" ",3,0,136

",3,1,88
216896F62055,"Concluding Statement.In Conclusion, The Theory of Emotion is about moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions,but it also may help produce them, And empathy may happen at some point of time when we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions. ",1,0,42
216A05AF987E,"Conclusion.Using software such as the Facial Action Coding System could be valuable in a classroom setting as it could improve the quality of learning for students. 
",5,2,27
216A05AF987E,"Conclusion.Often, when teachers ask if everyone understands the material, students who do not understand, will be too emabrassed to ask for help, or the teachers, with such a large class, will not notice if one or only a few students are falling behind. Furthermore, in the article, Dr. Huang states that ""'most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" meaning that most communication is picked up in other ways, such as visually. Unfortunately, often in a classroom setting, teachers must face away from their students when writing on a white board at the front of the classroom, or in similar situations, which means that without the visual connection, much of the communication between students and teachers is lost. The new technolgoy could help with this problem, as it could identify students' emotions even when a teacher's back is turned, and thus could alert teachers and help them improve their lessons to fit their students' needs. It could also help evaluate emotions that teachers do not notice, such as if a student is confused, they may try to hide it. This new technology could identify these emotions and help the teacher make sure all of their students understand the material, which would lead to an improved quality of teaching and learning.

22416450E0EF,"Conclusion.. For example, the famous filmmaker and entrepreneur Walt Disney was not always successful with his work. At the start of his career he drew little art work pieces for a small local newspaper company, although he wasn't able to profit from his drawings that much, he still loved his job because it was something he wanted and loved to do. It can be seen that people are able to go through tough times if they are able to express themselves freely. Another example would be is when my science class was assigned a group project and students had the freedom to do whatever they wanted to do. My group decided to do it on climate change, which wasn't very appealing to me at the time, but as I learned and dug in deeper into the topic, I found it more and more interesting which led to me being more educated in climate change and gaining new knowledge made it was more memorable. This shows that when students have the freedom to choose and design their own projects; it helps students learn something they never knew about, which leads to students being more educated. ",3,2,194

first i think that the face could of ben made up of dust and wind along time ago ",0,1,19
22E8627A3CB9,"Conclusion.The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressiveÂfor video games or video surgery. ÂMost human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,Â notes Dr. Huang. ÂSo computers need to understand that, too.ÂEckman has classified six basic emotionsÂhappiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadnessÂand then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when youÂre surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger. ",3,1,84
22FBB7ED7597,"Conclusion.The author mentioned that on the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet . His solution to survive this weather that is dangerous to us humans is to allow them to float above the fray. A ""blimp-like"" vehicle hovering 30 or so miles would help avoid the unfriendly ground conditions . At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth ",3,0,97

231FDA202B25,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion, the arguement is still ongoing, and doesn't seem to have a clear answer. I believe the stasis lies between finding a need for going to Venus, that isn't just the need for exploration, and a proven safe way to get and stay on Venus. The two perspectives are the author and the people opposing the author. The two issues are is there a need for exploaration and the safety of going to Venus. Therefore, with all the evidence provided to you, you can make a clear decision about if you want NASA going to Venus, or if you want NASA to stay grounded, but the author believes that you should side with him in support of Venus exploration.

236C5B5C92CB,Conclusion.One of the reasons would be that to use your phone to get your way through areas you have no idea how to get through or using your phone to find your way home from a place you have no knowledge on. The downside is that when the person glances at the phone to see where to turn or make a specific move they lose the focus on the road for a split second which could be fatal. Sometimes the use of a phone all depends on what kind of person it is. ,3,2,94
236C5B5C92CB,"Conclusion.The person could be a maniac when it comes down to how they use their phone, some people can't even live without it because they are so connected to it, for those specific people who have those kinds of issues when it comes down using their phones they should not be able to use their phone at all because they would then get distracted by the other uses. The amount of sheer will they would need to not get distracted by those other things would be entirely on them but in the mean time they should have no reason to use their phone. ",3,2,104

23C653E16CC8,"Conclusion.In the early years of space industry, numerous spacecraft have embarked on missions to the planet, but they were not able to return home. Unlike Earth, Venus has an atmosphere that is ""almost 97percent carbon dioxide"" with a surface temperature averaging ""over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"" and an ""atmospheric pressure [that] is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet""(Paragraph 3). Due to these extreme differences in temperature, pressure, and air content, Venus would be fairly inhospitable for humans. Usually when NASA launches missions to other planets they are trying to find alternatives habitats for the human race in the event that they cannot survive on Earth. If humans will not be able to withstand the conditions of Venus it is no longer a good option; therefore, it is not worth looking into since the author provides evidence that Venus would not be a useful living environment in the future.

25279CF8444F,"Conclusion.When the school year ends most students are just exited to know that they don't have to learn, knowing they can just relax, hang out with friends, or party. On the other hand, isn't this just holding them back in their learning process? Shouldn't they do some type of project that will allow them to exercise the mind and keep them learning? Well it is easier for the students and for the teachers when they come back from break and the students haven't completely forgotten everything that was taught to them the previous year, so some schools decided to have students do a project over the summer break that can help these students grow as intellectuals . Having said that, who should decide what project to do during the break, the teacher or the student? ",4,2,135
25279CF8444F,"Concluding Statement.All teachers want for their students is for them to be successful, in order for them to achieve such success they need to understand and go though the challenges that they have to face and the failures they must grow from in orderÂ for them to grow their knowledge as an individual. During the summer break, students benefit from having a project that can help them keep the knowledge they gained though out the school year, and not having to be shocked back into the next school year when they come back and have to re-learnÂ stuff from the previous year that they may have forgotten, after that they can finally move forward and learn new things ",1,2,119

It maps out a 3-D model of the face, looks at the shape and positoin of all the muscles, then it associates the different facial movements with differet emotion. For example, your orbicularis oris (muscles around your mouth) tighten your lips to show when you are angry. It even works when a person it trying to mask emotions. During a fake smile, the zygomatic major stretches the mouth sidways, while in a real smile the zygomatic major lifts the corners of the mouth. These examples can show how science IS able to understand emotoin, probaly better than most humans. Arguments that use that falshood, that science is unable to understand emotion, is completly false.

They only way we get any idea of venus and its surface is from the human eye. We are never able to get close anough for samples because we would need to get extremely close and we cant because of its heat, gases.

2D13EF90C1FA,"Conclusion.In paragraph 4 it says ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with Oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.

The author also states that, Today, Venus still has some features hat are analogous to these on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, maountains, and craters. They recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, but a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. In paragraph 5 it informs us that NASA says, that the visit would not have easy conditions, but survuvable for humans.

In paragraph 1 the author tells us that, Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star,"" si one of the brightest points of light in the sky, easy even for an amateur stargazer to spot. Although, this nickname is misleading since Venus is actually a planet. The author also claims that Venus is the second planet from our sun. It has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. Also referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, occasionally the closest in distance too. The author also says ""Earth, Venus, Mars, our other plaetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus."" He also states that Venus is sometimes right arounf the corner, in space terms.

In paragraph 2 the author claims ""Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challening planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" He also states that NASA has sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud- draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spacecraft has touched down on Venus more than three decades ago."" But NASA is still studying how they could get a better way to study Venus. ",3,1,352

No matter how hard the individual tried to get out of it, the individual still had to go through with the assignment. To complete the assignment, he or she will have to give up something.

2D5F50B0E765,"Conclusion.Some extracurricular clubs and groups require students to conduct a lot of work outside the club or group. In situations like this, students tend to worry about completing all work for their part of the group. For instance, students have different levels of productivity. Some can balance out school work and extracurricular work while others are not able to. If a student does not have high productivity, this may cause him or her to stress about all the work. While trying to balance out all this work, the students grades may begin to drop. This can lead to even more stress than the student can handle. Schools should not require students to participate in an extracurricular activity because some may begin to stress. ",3,2,124

2DA25C61D18D,"Conclusion.For example, two years ago, my former World History teacher, Mr Generic_Name, had us do a project over the summer about the most important events in world history. Fortunately, he gave the opportunity to choose our own format for the project. Luckily for my friend Generic_Name, he decided to complete the project in the form of a song, considering he was very musically talented. Over the summer he would plan when to work on it that best fit his schedule so he wouldn't be stressed to finish the song. He researched about the effects of World War II and finished his song in no time. He stated that it was one of the best projects he had ever completed because for the first time, he felt like he actually learned something while doing an activity that he loved and had fun with. This clearly shows the effects of giving students a choice in designing their own projects for the best learning experience. ",3,2,163

2E0AF5C8526F,"Conclusion.The process begins when the computer constructs a three-dimensional computer model of the face. All forty-four major muscles in the model must move like a human muscle. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit."" The facial expressions we use for each emotion is universal. The software can identify mixed emotions.

The software is the latest innovation from Professor Thomas Huang. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. He then relies on his pyschologist Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of Facial Action Coding System. He has classified six basic emotions like happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", it tells us how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. ""Why would they want this? ",3,1,144
2E0AF5C8526F,"Concluding Statement.The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. Yes, we can actually calculate emotions, like math homework. The computer can recognize your emtions through software and through a special program Dr. Paul Eckman created. ",1,0,39
2E4A8624CB67,Conclusion.I think that the author has a good point her beacuse it teaches the reading that Mars is not the only chicos with this we get to see that ther is other chicos that we can pick if one day we have to leave plant earth. Venus is a instreting plant because its sometimes cloeser to us then mars and it can help understand how to take care of earth. With this we get to see what we can change and what. We dont need to change about our plant Earth and what we do need to chance. Earth is a good plant but Venus is a plant that we dont fully understand as most plants Venus is a plant that is new to the human kind. ,4,1,128
2E4A8624CB67,Conclusion.`I think that us as human need to study Venus close and see waht it really is can see if it can help us understand our plant more and more. ,5,0,31

The software uses video imagery, the emtion-recognition software track there facial movement in a real face or a painted face. ",3,1,45
2E7245D9A04D,Concluding Statement.Therefore computer should be used to scan students emotions just so maybe is its really bad the school can do something for that student and get them the help they need.

This will only cause more stress on teachers and students who rather spend their time worrying about their own work. Students who may have had an older sibling in the same class tell them what to expect and then them receiving something completely different angers students. Students stick to the idea that everyone should get what others get, nothing different. If they receive something opposing their original belief, they will bring it to the teacher's attention almost immediately. The importance of teacher-designed projects is to inform the student not cause arguments. In addition, it will also limit the amount of work teachers have to put in.

Pollution is the second largest source of America's emissions just behind power plants. Many sociologist have seen these statistics and have also noticed that American transportation usuage has slowly been declining since its peak in 2005. People are slowly but surely helping the cause in their own ways, whether its by delaying getting there license, limit there driving, or even car-pooling with friends.

Every human can make the same face everyday, but you can probably tell when your friend is sad or happy just by looking at their face. While for somepeople its hard to tell when their friends feel happy, sad, confused etc. Dr. Huang got a picture of the Mona Lisa and made people look at it to tell if a computer can recognize your feelings. They also showed people a web ad that appears on a computer screen, If the person frowned the ad would change and when you smile a similar ad would appear.

32D94C1BA4A5,"Conclusion.You've probably seen someone text and drive. In the few seconds they take to glance away from the road and at their phones, a car crash could happen. It only takes one second for your car to swerve into the other lane. Phones should never be used while driving for many reasons, and the main reason being that it is extremely dangerous. Texting and driving makes you 23% more likely to get in an accident. It's so much smarter to wait until you've reached your destination to use your phone. If you can't wait, you can pull over on the side of the road. If not, you could greatly risk your life. ",3,2,113
32D94C1BA4A5,"Conclusion.In georgia, for instance, holding a cellphone while not parked, or even pressing one button on a phone can get you a ticket. With each offense, the fines get larger. It's not worth paying a large ticket to send a short text message. Additionally, if someone dies in a car crash because of your actions, such as texting and driving, you could be charged with vehicular manslaughter and go to jail for up to 20 years. Texting and driving tickets, if shown on a police report for a wreck you are responsible for, will greatly increase your insurance rates, making your life a lot harder than it was before you decided to text and drive. Unless you have a money tree in your backyard and don't mind ridiculous insurance for the rest of your life, its best to wait until you get home to use your phone. ",3,2,148

During the summer if students were allowed to develop their own projects they would feel more free, this would allow them to experiment with different ideas and concepts, this also would allow them to figure out which way they learn best. While being away from an instructor such as a teacher, kids could use their own ideas to create a project, that is not influenced by others, and this would show schools and teacher how much a student truly understands not just the knowledge that a teacher is forcing upon them. A sense of freedom is also important for preparing students for their next step in life, whether it is a higher education level, or a career, because, it is important students get an experience learning by themselves.

The author thoroughly describes the plan provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to allow astronauts to float above the fray and avoid the hazardous conditions. They provide specific qualities of the plan, such as the air pressure being close to the sea level on Earth, the abundance of solar power, and the containment of radiation, to prove how humans would be kept in a safe atmosphere. They even provide a real world connection between NASA's possible solution and a blimp-like vheicle hovering around the ground to make it easier for the audience to understand.

Additionally, students don't just see their classmates when they go to their chosen activity, there are other kids from other grades there as well, so it's the perfect chance to meet unfamiliar people, and chat with familiar people, too. To add to that, the activity likely brings out skills in others that you didn't know they had, and that enables students to connect with one another and find out more about each other. ",3,2,113
3D3E4F0B74D2,"Conclusion.Venus has value because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself just like intimidating endeavors does as well.

This helps to strive to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value. ",3,1,63
3D3E4F0B74D2,"Concluding Statement.So, because our travels should not be limited by dangers and doubts, intimidating endeavors should only be expanded to meet the imagination and innovation of the travel.

So, because Venus is simple to see from the distant and because our travels should be expanded, studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it only presents a small amount of dangers.

3D7B1F039322,"Conclusion.Charts, flip charts, and simulations are all used by most teachers to show information that is important. In the summer, students aren't going to want to do homework regardless but if the project is set up with clear and concise directions, it makes the work seem less daunting otherwise. For example, if a student had planned a project, the project would only make sense to them because they are responsible for planning it out and the steps needed. When that transfers onto paper, other students won't know what is happening in the brain of the student who created it and will be confused. ",3,2,104
3D7B1F039322,"Conclusion.If students were given the opportunity to create their own summer assignment, it would most likely end up being under 5 questions with minimal work needed to be done in order to complete it. This does not help the students in any way, shape, or form. Teenagers look for the quick and easy results that aren't as available as they think in the real world. The point of high school is to prepare you for college. If the work you do in high school is easy and not challenging there is a greater risk for those students to struggle more in college with the huge increase in course work. There are some students who crave the challenge and look for the ability to better themselves. ",3,2,126

They have said that no spacecraft has survived the landing for more than a few hours ,despite its proximity to us and, of course should like a big danger and risk to take, not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.

3D9CBC4F434F,"Conclusion.despite the risks, they are working on innovations that allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of venus, and some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simlating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. But now they use mechanical computers which were first envisioned in the 1800s and played lots of important roles in the 1940s, by comparison systems that use mechanical parts can be more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.

41CC238F5738,"Conclusion.in middle school, there's a lot of homework, even more so in high school. A lesson is usually about an hour and a half long. School ends at 3:30, so they'd get home at 5:00. 5 or 6 is the most common dinner time, and it usually lasts about 30 minutes. That's 5:30. Then, they have to go and try to finish their homework. If they have a lot of it, it can take a long time, and can usually lead to them putting off important stuff, like personal hygiene (GROSS!). They're probably super exhausted from their activity, and just want to take a shower. But nope, they have to do the rest of their homework. Depending on how much they have, they could end up staying up really late. Highschoolers can usually end up staying up until 3 am in the morning doing homework.

45EBD1AF6D37,"Conclusion.the challenge of exploring venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. however, this nickname, is misleading since venus is actually a planet. In a solar system, venus is the second planet from our sun.

they call venus like the earth twin..

Venus is the closest to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, venus, and mars,our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. While venus is simple to see from the distant but safe ventage pointof Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.

MY ESSAY.

The callenge of exploring venus is one of the biggest points of light in the night sky, these differences is speed mean that sometimes we are closer to mars and others times to venus. Because venus is sometimes right aroundthe corner in space terms humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent dioxide blankets venus. Also notable, venus has the hottest surface temperature af any planet in our solar system, even though mercury is closer to our sun. astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most Earth like planet in our solar system. long ago, venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such ass valleys, mountains, and craters. Imagine a blimp like behicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling venusian landscape. However, peering at venus from a ship orbiying or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions bacuse most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendiring standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent dioxide blankets venus. ",3,1,345

490867E5D019,"Conclusion.A small, but very important thing teachers have in common is that they have a lesson plan. A lesson plan is what teachers utilize to understand what curriculum they will teach and how they will teach it. As a result, the teacher can use the curriculum as their foundation of the project. For example, the International Baccalaureate, IB, program requires students to complete a Summer Reading Project. As an IB student, I had to complete it this past summer. We had a list of books to choose from, and we had to write an essay about the message of the book and make a poster about what we learned from the book. What I didn't realize, was that the book had a connection to what we were going to learn in class. The project helped the students make a connection to the class and learn faster and more efficiently. This results would not be possible, if a student designed the project so this is why summer project should be designed by a teacher. ",3,2,174
490867E5D019,"Conclusion.Teachers most go to college to become teachers and be hired by a school. This means: they have a degree on education, are certified to be teachers, and they understand the subject better than students. In addition, they have experience from previous years and students. So they understand that students learn differently. Consequently, they can come up with a method to make the project educative and impactful for every student; regardless, of how different they learn. For these reasons, the summer projects should be teacher designed.

490867E5D019,Conclusion.While this statement is true it is bias. ,6,0,9
490867E5D019,"Conclusion.It's bias, because students are often with their friend group which often understand each other. On the other hand, friend groups are all different, meaning they have different beliefs and values. Another reason, the statement is bias is that students have different learning styles. A student can be a fast learner and don't need to study as hard as others students; however, another student might need more reinforcement to learn. ",3,2,71
490867E5D019,"Conclusion.So if a student was to design a project it would be based on their personal preference and not about everyone. Concluding, that summer projects should not be designed by students because they can be bias. ",0,2,37
490867E5D019,"Concluding Statement.As a conclusion, summer projects have to be teacher-designed. It must be designed by teachers, so students can learn efficiently and effectively. Also, it can help the teacher understand and get to know the student through their summer project.Â  ",1,0,41

4FAC3B29417F,"Conclusion.With their research and project, students can essentially ""test drive"" their intended career, instead of waiting until college to discover that they are completely uninterested in their major. For example, one student may desire to become an elementary school teacher. In her project, she decides to research how to become a teacher and the skills that the profession requires. After completing her research, she creates a binder of lesson plans that correspond with her state's standards of learning for her grade of choice. Consequently, she discovers that she truly has a passion for teaching and is reassured on her career choice through this student-designed summer project.

50122C17BAD4,"Conclusion.Venus is sometimes called the ""Evening Star"". Its one of the brightest points of light in the sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. In our solar system, Venus is the second planet from the sun. While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.

First, there's a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. On the planets surface temperatures average over 800 degress Fahrenheit, and the atomospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we expreinced on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liqefy many metals. Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather presnt additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

However, peering at venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atomosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to out knowledge of Venus.

Last, NASA is working on other approches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Another project is looking back to an technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important rolein the 1940s during World War 2. The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. ",3,1,435
505E8295E792,Conclusion.I think we shoud do whatever we think is right.    ,5,1,11
507CBD8E9670,"Conclusion.Venus is often reffered to as Earth's twin because it is the closest planet to be like Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Venus would be hard to expore becuase of the planet's suface reaching up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet of solar system and if we tried to land a rover there the metal would just liquify because of the extreme temperature's. NASA however, still wants to try to study the planet but they would have to hover over Venus because of the extreme conditions on the planet's surface. Even at 30 plus miles in the air in Venus the temperatures can reach up to 170 degrees Fahrenheit. However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere. Rendering standard of photography and videography ineffective. The solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth's level.

More importantly, reasearchers cannot take samples of rock, gas,or anything else, from a distance. Threfore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Many reasearchers are working on innovations that would allow the machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. ",3,1,255

5402D8B83297,Conclusion.One reason why I think student should design their project is because some students travel to anotherÂ country. Sometimes to go visit family or to have new experience. If students are able to design their project they can make it based on If they went to a different country. They will be able to learn about there culture and how it is different from where the student is from. If they visit family from a different country they can have a little interview with there family and they can turn that into a project. It will give them so much options on what to do there projects on ,3,0,109

5412AD81F965,Conclusion.Choosing the topic allows the student to truly express themselves and talk about something they enjoy. They won't feel as if they are being forced to do a topic they do not want to do. It will allow them to speak and explain something that they are passionate about. This will later help teachers learn more about what their students are interested in. If they are doing a project on something they enjoy it is likely they will put more effort into the project to make sure it is good work and not just some garbage quickly thrown together at the end of summer. ,3,2,105

5484CC372842,"Conclusion.Summer break is the time where most students proceed to pursue hobbies, enjoy lifes moments, spend time with people that are cared about, and make memorial memories. Over break, students tend to discover their true passions and focus on what drives their interest. With projects being assigned, that can be tough and build a wedge between the situation. If summer projects were to be student-designed however, students can make it more personalized and just have fun with it. I believe making the summer projects more personalized to students, can really ease the stress and make it more enjoyable. Overall, it is summer break. As a student myself, a time where this applied to me was in the summer of my freshman year. My teacher had assigned a summer project where we had to determine the area of different shapes in any form. Art is a huge passion of mine and I wanted to engage more of it into my summer. I decided to paint an abstract painting with a variety of shapes; circles, triangles, squares, you name it. It turned out beautiful, I really enjoyed spending my time on something that was educating and delightful. ",3,2,196

This was and opportunity for me to be drafted in the military service.

I couldn't tell my friend no. So I went with him. The cattle-trip were an unbelieveable opportunity for a small -town boy.

Also, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA(the United Relief and Rehabilitation). I had the side benefit of seeing

Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis in Greece.

It took about to weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the united states and a month to get to china.

Also I think should because he really does anything bad in the story he just things that won't get him in trouble. But also he is a good child in the story he deserves to be in that program because their is no actual reson he can't be part of that program. Also Luke does really deserve to be in that program because i don't think he has been in any other program in his life as it said in the story. But one thing that really stands out to me is that why cant he be part of that program because their really is no reason that he shouldn't be in that program.

Why Luke should be part of the program. I think that Luke should be part of that program because in the story it said that Luke really wants to be in that program because he has worked his whole life to be in that program. And another one of the reasons I think that he should be in that progrsm because he has worked his whole life for to get that program and also in the story it said that Luke would not give up to get into that program and be part of the program because he thinks that he deserves to be in that program and I think that he is qualified to be on that program.

why I think that Luke should be in that program. He deserves to be in that program because he their is no reason he should't be in that program. He is also a hard worker like it said in the text if I was Luke I would never give up to getting into that academy because if that was my dream I would never stop trying to get into that academy because I want to do something important in my life like join the academy Luke wants to join or be a doctor I never give up on my dreams. that why I think Luke should join that academy.

5716C4DAFC9E,"Conclusion.It is very important to have good friends throughout middle school and high school because you will need people to talk to about things, support you in situations. and even just to share laughter and spend time with that aren't your family. For example, when i started middle school my parents made me try out for track, which i really didn't want to do. After a few days, i had made so many great friends that i could not only hang out with at practice, but i also then knew them at school. To this day, i am even better friends with those people, therefore, i can't imagine what my life would be like if i hadn't tried out for track. Another example is my older brother made his closest friends, Generic_Name and Generic_Name, in football when he first started high school. Before that, he didn't have many good friends; football really changed his life in that way, for i never see him happier than when he is with them. ",3,2,171
5716C4DAFC9E,"Conclusion.If you aren't required to do something, most of the time you probably won't do it unless it interests you; however if you are required to do something, you will be forced to do it no matter what, but you might surprise yourself, and find interest in that thing after all. Like mentioned previously, my parents made me try out for track when i first started middle school. At first, i wasn't the biggest fan of the idea, but i decided to give it a try; i ended up surprising myself, and Absolutely loved it. I was one of the best sprinters on my team, and found running to be a great way to release my negative energy from the day. Another example of this is my friend Generic_Name; she had no interest in sewing at all, but her mom forced her to try the sewing club at her school. Vivian ended up really enjoying it, and found it very therapeutic, as it was a great way to let out her stresses from the school day. ",3,2,177

Learning to work with people is one of the most important things you need to know how to do.

So the sooner that you start, the better the future that you will have.

If you don't know how to work with people, then the path that is in front of you is rough because nobody will want to hire you, nobody will want to work with you, and nobody will have sympathy for you.

Nobody will hire you because they will look at your back roundÂ and see nothing in you that will help them in their work space.

Nobody will want to work with you because you will be mean and do little to no work.

59A14F276C3E,"Conclusion.When teachers are able to create their own summer projects, they can show students the types of assignments that they will see in class, giving the students ample time to understand and adapt to the teacher's standards. They allow students to not only learn new information, but also new strategies and techniques that will help them succeed during the school year. For example, my friend who attends a neighboring high school had a summer assignment from her AP Language teacher, while I had none. She was able to learn all of the rhetorical techniques her teacher wanted her know, as well as how to approach that level of work, over the summer, leaving her well-prepared for the class when it started. I, however, faced a steep learning curve at the start of the year as I tried to figure out my AP Lang assignments while also trying to keep up with all my other schoolwork. Comparatively, my friend had a much eaiser time than I did because she already knew the neccessary skills, having learned it all over the summer. Therefore, teacher-designed summer projects allow students to see how their classes will operate during the school year and respond accordingly, giving them an easier, more prepared start to the year.

A student council is not the only activity that can boost your communication skills. Those skills will increase anywhere thatÂ you are working together, which is usually any activity. By improving your communication skills, you are preparing for the future. You will need to be able to have excellent communication skills during college, work, and just daily life. In addition, you could make many friends. According to the Brain Like Mindedness Observation Assessments, people with the same interests typically make better friends. A club is just a bunch of people gathered together doing an activity that they enjoy. There are plenty of chances to make a friend. So next time nobody wants to join a club with you, don't worry.

6120EF6FC0BF,"Conclusion.If the students design their own projects, they will not be introduced to their teachers style of assessment until the beginning of the year and will have a harder time on the first few assignments in that class. My ninth grade history teacher was very different compared to any teacher I had before. The first project he assigned was very tricky and I did not really know what to do. I ended getting a bad grade on it but I eventually got used to his project style later on in the year. If he had given us a project designed by him over the summer I would have been more prepared for the first real projects of the year. On the other hand, my ninth grade English teacher gave us a summer reading project of her own creation that really helped at the beginning of the year. By completing that assignment, I was prepared for the year because the reading got me used to the workload of the class, and the project got me ready for future similar reading projects that we did every month. If every teacher assigned a manageable project, designed by themselves, every student would com into that class at the beginning of the year prepared and comfortable with all their assigned projects.

61607C674FA3,"Conclusion.Furthermore, all different ages of students today are constantly stressed out with the massive workload that is forced upon them each day. One of the many consequences of this is that the students may not actually be learning the material beceause of how focused they are on the responsibilities they have for other classes. A facial recognition system such as FACS could be programmed to detect when a student's facial expression demonstrates stress, and notify the school so they can proactively help the student cope with this stress before the situation worsens. This will help the student relax and focus better. ",3,2,102
6198205BB70E,"Conclusion.Productivity heightens when the task is something one actually wants to be doing. If the teacher is somewhat forcing the task, it will make students back away from what they need to complete. Since the student them selfÂ is coming up with the project, they must have more motivation to do so which makes the entire process much more productive. Especially during the summer, productivity may decrease because students are no longer in the correct head space that schoolwork requires. If the project is teacher- designed, then the productivity relating to the project will continue to dwindle as well. If the project is student-designed, the time and effort put into the project would heighten which would increase the productivity of the project as well. Hence my reasoning as to why summer projects should be student-designed rather than having them be teacher-designed. ",3,2,142

619D4176B04A,"Conclusion.While it can be said that creating the project would allow the students to retain the information better, there is no guarantee that the information itself would be accurate. Any student can make a worksheet or an assignment based on what they have learned, but few can do it correctly. If student-designed projects are done incorrectly, then the purpose of the project is completely disregarded; the entire point of the summer projects is to make sure students do not forget valuable information. Having teacher-designed projects is a safer and more reliable option. Teachers have studied the subject for years and have experience, meanwhile students are only just beginning to understand the concepts of the subject. Teachers must be able to determine whether or not what they are doing with their students is not superficial, but actually necessary and needed for the students ",3,2,143

61A0FEA827E4,"Conclusion.Now for a story. In my entire life ive only had one summer project and it was back in middle school. The goal was to just read a chapter book and then to write about it.

Countless people aspire to become teachers, are we ready to take that away? Even if teachers were to work hand in hand with this technology there would still be flaws. Having a computer read the emotions of a student rather than a teacher would sever immportant student teacher ties, and cheat that student of the oppurtunity of a mentor relasionship. Because people are already capable of reading emotions, it would be foolish to replace that for a less precise piece of equipment.

67B4E798A5B4,"Conclusion.The author supports this idea. That Venus is actually a planet. in our solar system, Venus is the second planet from our sun. While Venus is simple to see from the challenging place to examine more closely. Often referred to as Earth's twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in term of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's perputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.

A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything human encounter on Earth; such an eveironment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.

If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface? Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar sytem. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some feartures that are analogous to those on Earth The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features sych as valleys mountains, and creaters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit,a crucial consideration given the long time farmes of space travel. The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the optionsfor making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particulry compelling ideafor sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fary. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. at thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperature would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.

Striving to meet the Challenge presented by Venushas value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. our tarvels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

6A97E65BBE95,"Conclusion.Venus, somethimes called the ""Evenig Star"" is the closest planet to Earth. this planets have differents such as, the size between their, the speed that they move around the sun, this speed mean tht sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus.

The big question here is, why humans never visited this planets in more l tha three decades. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, no since no spacecraft survived the landing for more that a few hours. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.

A thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets Venus. On the planet's surface temperatures average oner 800 degrees Fathrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Also notable, Venus has the hottest sufrace temperature of any planet of solar system, wheather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, and powerful earthquakes.

The National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) has one particulary idea for sending humans to study Venus, Venus would aviod the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up andout of their way, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit. No easy conditions, but survivable for humans.

However, Venus can provide only limited insinght on ground conditions because most forms on light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. ",3,1,254
6AE4BFE2E5CF,"Conclusion.As well, a student-designed project could angle more in the direction of what the student wants to learn about. Students are forced to spend hours of a day paying attention to subject matters that they don't care for in order to get a generalized education. However, the point of a summer project is education itself, not education towards the goal of a degree. Students would be able to design a project that deepens their interest in a topic, broadens their knowledge in a niche industry. Education would feel more like a hobby than a chore if a student could account for what they learn and how they want to learn it. ",3,2,112
6AE4BFE2E5CF,"Conclusion.Going through a program that teaches them in a way that they both understand and enjoy would be exciting and possibly life changing. The modern school system is the most monstrous source of stress on the childhood and adolescent mind. Even though learning should be acknowledged as a privilege, wonder, and necessity, it becomes a burden to students. Between the forced socialization of the classroom environment, administrations that care more for policy than the experience of the individual, a constantly building workload, and a set of rules and grades that are constantly judging and disciplining behavior, schooling becomes nightmarish for students. The poor environment weighs so heavily on the minds of children that they often develop mental illnesses or complexes, and, in extreme cases, are driven to suicide over poor grades (which, in the grand scheme of life, should be menial). Student-designed summer projects would be a way to show students that learning can be a growing and nurturing experience, instead of a murderous one. That change in outlook in the mind of a student could make all the difference in that student's optimism, well being, and quality of life for the rest of their schooling career. ",3,2,198

6C3B801F92D2,"Conclusion.people all over the world are paying attention to what they can do to help the environment, meaning that this is an advantage that will appeal to a widespread audience. One way that limiting car usage will help is that it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's essay ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", she writes, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 2 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"". By limiting the usage of cars, the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted into the world would decrease substantially. While the idea that everyone would stop using their cars and the gas emissions caused by them would disappear completely is unrealistic, the prospect that a majority of the emissions could do so is perfectly reasonable. The reduction of these emissions would mean that the air quality would increase and be overall healthier for both all the world's population and all the wildlife across the world. Robert Duffer provides another example of how less car usage would impact the environment in his essay, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"". According to the article, an intense smog had covered Paris for five days, when the city decided to ban car usage over the course of two days. The cause for the smog was thought to be the high use of diesel fuel in France, with 67 percent of cars using it over gasoline, about 14 percent higher than the rest of Western Europe. The plan for the ban had been that cars with even-numbered license plates to not be used the first day and for ones with odd-numbered license plates not to be used the next day. In actuality, cars with odd-numbered plates were never banned from driving since the smog had cleared just after the first day. This shows the impact of limiting car usage. In just one day, a smog that was comarable to the one in Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world, was removed considerably after just half the normal amount of cars were used over the course of a day. If this was used all over the world, the result would be even more significant. This evidence supports that limiting car use is good for the environment in more ways than one. ",3,2,396

6D1FB567121E,"Conclusion.Creativity is an important part of every child'sÂ life, not being able to use it will make a child dull. For example, when someone does not practice or use something they often lose their ability to do it. Additionally, student-designed projects would let students show who they really are and what they enjoy. When students can show who they really are they feel happy and good about themselves. Also, when they can express what they enjoy they will attract other classmates that enjoy the same thing. Having friends that enjoy the same thing they do will not only improve their happiness but will also improve their work ethic towards what they enjoy. For example, I am in very demanding and somewhat difficult classes. Having friends in the same classes as me with the same goals makes it a lot easier. Without them I would most likely not work nearly as hard. ",3,2,152

It is an extremely difficult task to accomplish, as most rovers NASA has sent there have not lasted more than a mere few hours.

This is primarily because of the way our daily lives are ran. Work is a necessity to support for one's own and their families, so getting to work, whether by car or by bus, is something that will not stop. However, the alternatives of tranportation allow us to reach that goal without using gas-emitting cars or buses. Bikes and even hybrid cars are now rising up in today's society; ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009"". (Source #4).

The extra activities at the end of the day can add on up to 4 hours of extra time to the already long school day, making it up to 50 hours per week. Some sports practicesÂ even go until 7:30 PM and also require students to meet on the weekends. Students are already exhausted and unhappy with the current school day, and forcing an extra 15 hours a week will have a devastating effect on the previously unhappy students. ",3,2,100
75C4CC1ABECF,"Conclusion.Many students are involved in extracurricular activities that are not school sponsored and are run by an organization outside of school. If school forces the students to join an activity, it will take up more time. ",0,2,37
75C4CC1ABECF,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion, schools should not allow students to choose whether they would like to participate in extracurricular activities because it can decrease the quality of the clubs, create unhappiness among students, and cause students to be even more busy and leaving students unavailable for other non-school related activities. Giving students the freedom to be able to choose whether they would like to participate lets students have more power. Taking away that power and putting just another thing thats forced on to their plate will cause students even more stress and discomfort.Â  ",1,2,93

761E554AE3D8,"Conclusion.With global warming increasing by the day, any step to reduce pollution and greenhouse gases should be taken, limiting car usage is an essential tool to head in that direction. As a Elisabeth Rosenthal from the New York Times expounded: ""Passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" Clearly cars are extremely harmful to the environment. However there is hope, because once car usage is limited these high numbers can be mitigated everywhere. In fact, in Paris, as Robert Duffer from the Chicago Tribune reported, policies to lower car usage have been taken and have actually worked! In France's capital ""motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine. The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" In hopes to reduce carbon emmissions and save the environment, Paris's prayers were answered as the smog cleared enough for the government to remove the ban for odd-numbered plates. Clearly, the pollution reduced due to one factor--limiting car usage. If actions around the world are initiated similar to Paris's plan, then a better environmental future is inevitable. The environmental benefits of reducing car usage are endless. After all we only have one planet, cars should not be the machines to dictate our environmental future. ",3,2,233

76CDE9069DBE,"Conclusion.Students over the summer usually want to save time for leisure activities. When the idea of school comes into the minds of these students, it can be seen as agitating. When you add the freedom to make your own project the way you want, there can be downsides for the student and the teacher ",3,0,55
76CDE9069DBE,"Concluding Statement.Summer projects are something to make sure students keep learning over their break. It's clear to see that teacher-designed projects are much more efficient. Without the guidance of teachers, students could make simplistic projects that offer no benefit for the teacher or student. The teacher's knowledge about the project could make it helpful for their students to keep learning different ways about the material. It is also common for students to forget or lose interest when they are given too much responsibility for an assignment. Student-designed projects can leave room for a large quantity of errors and mistakes that could ultimately defeat the purpose of a project. Therefore, teacher- designed projects are better in the sense that they can keep the student learning as if they are still in school but give them time to enjoy the benefits that come with summer break.Â Â    Â    Â  ",1,2,145
7742D58270C9,"Conclusion.Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush.

78B951722074,"Conclusion.Summer break has always been an important time for students to relax, spend more time bonding with their families, and travel to new places. Although summer is typically a nice and warm few months for destressing, I know that my summer is always packed with sports, trips, and visits from family. But what if the kids return back to school having completely cut off their school learning for 3 months? Schools then add teacher organized projects to the agenda, meaning for families there is always a week or more at the end of summer where everyone is cramming to get all their project work done. This almost constantly leads to less time to enjoy the end of summer, parents having to be involved, and unfocused, rushed work being handed in on the first day of school. However, there is a solution: Students design and lead their own projects, based off their own interests and activities. Letting students lead their own projects still assures that they are spending time learning, but eliminates several of the negative factors. ",4,2,177

For the most students, summer is the only opportunity that they have to relax, or spend time with family and friends. Vacations and family events are usually panned to take place during the summer.

79887DA7C1B1,"Concluding Statement.As previously stated, summer is usually an important time for both students and teachers. Rather they use it to participate in activities, or family events. Or, relax and take a break from school and work. At the end of the day, a student's education is important to maintain. But, so is their time and schedules. That is why students should be the ones to design their own summer project. Along with the fact that it would lighten up a teachers work load so they as well could enjoy their time off. ",1,0,93

7A347C69D3D1,"Concluding Statement.Summer assignments come in a variety of ways, but having them based on the teacher's units and plans for the school year will prepare both student and teacher. Summer projects can be used in any subject to benefit the teacher and allow a smooth year for easier teaching when knowing the students skill set and be prepared to change plans to accommodate these. As a student continues to move up the grades and start taking college leveledÂ classes, it is imperative to have some incoming knowledge of the subject and to expand on previous skills. Summer projects can either be student designed or teacher designed, but in the end a student ill benefit only if the assignment is based on the teacher. ",1,2,124

80031EC3D9B6,"Conclusion.From small town suburbs to largely populated cities, car usage can drastically affect a community. In developed worlds, personal automobiles are an increasingly popular trend, and help people go about their day to day business. Many would rather drive down the street to a grocery store of job instead of walking there even though it is common knowledge that the pollution and other harmful emissions cars create is bad for the enviroment and the people living there.

Unless you are a business owner of a car dealership or working for a delivery company, limited car usage means very postive things for social relationships, health, the enviroment, and general living conditions of a busy city. The less harmful emissions of gases from cars could greatly affect the outcome of our clean, energy efficient future.       Â     ",1,2,100

For one reason it would have to be when they painted a picture of her for acomplishing the process of the model of a great model she smiled for that picture. So that is why that gave her own picture of herself and the computer model picture is a little bit better than the orignal one. The computer model has better details in the picture and it also tightens her lips for the picture. More reason is that they express the emotion of her picture in paragraph 2. In paragraph 7 the experts for the picture tell Mona Lisa how to pose for the picture in the first sentence. Paragraph 8 explains Mona being truthful and smiling in the last sentence.

84DA3A4E84CC,"Conclusion.Designing their own promotional plans, students from the Technology Student Association were able to pursue college business majors. The Technology Student Association allowed students to be completely in charge of their own work to get a sense of the leadership that is needed in many technology and business fields today. As a result, the ones who were consistent in their work and created their own designs were the most successful at the TSA regional competitions. Student-designed projects allows students to be in control and have the opportunity to manage work responsibly. Even though having a teacher-designed project can help in follow instructions and meeting deadlines, being ones own boss opens doors to many leadership opportunities to excel in the work field, and in ones personal life.

Panera Bread employees that have shown leadership development have moved to higher job positions. In the food industry, like most jobs, employees must start off with a lower position and must enhance their abilities in order to move up to a higher position. For example, in Panera Bread, most new employees start of working as a cashier, dining room attendant, or produce worker; these minor positions prepare the employee with basic skills and prepare them for future duties. Later, when more experience is gained, employees move up to trainer or manager assistant.

84DB11599420,"Conclusion.Time and time again summer projects are dreaded by students and a task that many do not look forward to. As a result, students are left unhappy during summer break in regards to completing a project their teacher designed. This is either because the project has limitations, is about an uninteresting topic, or is difficult to complete. These factors can leave students feeling demoralized from completing their summer project and can make summer break a dreary time. Despite these conditions that come with teacher-designed projects, these problems can be solved with student-designed projects. When given the chance to explore what interests you and choosing whether any limitations exist regarding your project, inevitably students are inclined to complete summer projects. From the perspective of a student, you have more motivation to work on a self-designed project. This increased motivation correlates to an increase in mental health.

Many say that this environment makes them happier because it is so peaceful. 70% of the community do nott own cars and the ones that do must leave it in a large parking garage outside the developementÂ  that is purchased with the home. In another article, also written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, discusses America and the recentÂ  decrease of the amount of driven by a single person. Research shows that the amount driven in 1995 is about the same as the amount driven in 2013. This is due to environmental protectionists who walk evrywhere they go and due to the dangers of driving.

89A2F3489EC7,"Conclusion.In ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", author Elisabeth Rosenthal shares the story of Vauban, Germany and their efforts to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmisions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" The impact of these gas emmsions is incredibly negative on cities. They make the environment unstable and unsafe for a large number of people. These numbers could easily be reduced if fewer people chose to rely on cars as their mode of transportation. In some places the pollution caused by automobiles is so high that the government is stepping in to assist in the management of city spaces. In ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", author Robert Duffer explains this specific situation in Paris, France. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" The effects of this temporary ban were also shared. ""Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after five-days of intesifying smog."" It is easy to see that just a small reduction of vehicles created a significant change. ",3,2,232

It's not necessarily that they're lazy, but they just dont see the importance of going out of their way to do something that they can't see the immediate benefits to. Enforcing the change could arouseÂ some anger in a vast majority of students, and possibly parents, but if the students are given an option to not participate in an extracurricular activity, things would most likely run a lot smoother. Most people would call these types of kids, ""average"" due to the fact that they settle for the amount of work given, and typically don't want to exceed expectations. Perhaps making them participate in beneficial activities wouldn't hurt, they just need to be a little more open minded to the idea at hand. ",3,2,141

In my high school experience, I tend to remember projects that I was truly interested in, rather than the monotonous ones designed by teachers (that solely get work out of you). Projects are meant to be engaging, so that later down in life you can recall the learning experience. This difference proves that creative work fosters quality rather than quantity. Furthermore, a teacher-designed project inhibits a student's potential to express their creative mindset. By receiving a topic and a guideline on how one should complete a project, a student becomes mentally set on pursuing that one path, disregarding all other options. This mental block of creativity can be harmful to a growing teenager as the advancement of society is dependent on creative thinkers which student-designed projects help create. ",3,2,149

91AEF41A3766,"Conclusion.In the story ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" Luke was a cowboy rode the waves. he helped people in Europe after War World 2. Luke went to Europe to help people that didn't have shelter, food or animals. When Luke just graduated highschool his friend Don asked him if he wanted to go to Europe. Luke knew he couldn't pass this opportunity of a lifetime up.44 Nations joined together to form

UNRRA [ther United Nations Relief and Rehabilitaton Administration.] ""UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cowes, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke and Don signed up."" Luke wanted to help people if he didn't go he wouldn't like to help people.

'Luke did get some free time when he was on the boat he got to see Venice, Italy he also toured an excavated castle in Crete and mareled at the Panama

China"" he got to see many things many people don't get the chance to ever see. It was an aventure for him. ""it took about to weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to china"" It was hard work to keep ever animal safe and alive on the long journey and animals could have died of sickness and cancer and a lot of other thing like not getting any excercie. "" Heping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared Luke for hard work, but not for dangers at sea. On Lukes second trip, Luke served as night watchman. His job awas to cheack on all the animals every hour. One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captian, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. Luke's haert raced as he shot feet firt toward an opening on the side of the ship. a small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overborad into the dark Atlantic. He was happy to be alive. But he couyld not work for a coulpe of days because of vraked ribs."" He was really happy to be alive and he was ok with craked ribs because he was alive. ",3,1,374

Luke said it took about two weeks to cross the Alantic Ocean and a mounth to get to China. Luke was carring for the animals that were crossing and they had to fed and waterd two or three times a day.

the animals food had to be pulled from the lower holds of the ship so they could eat. Luke was prepard for this because he had to help out on his aunts farm.

One of the biggest issues with this topic is that in its simple form it looks like a great idea, but when you look at the details and what it would cause it shows the big mistake it would be. Giving every student the chance to do an interactive activity they enjoy would be incredible. Sadly, doing that in our current school system would cause all after school activities to stop going to competitions due to the over crowding; The students would not be able to pick their own activity and would be forced to do something they are bad at or just dislike. Making the activities would not only be a punishment to the students of Generic_School but to the teachers, the bus drivers, the custodians, the administrators, the taxpayers, and even our entire county's well being. In this scenario it may at first look like everybody wins, but really when you look at the real facts everybody loses.

This is essential because it allows students to be more engaged in learning, since it will no longer be as boring as it was for them. The system may also help students to remain engaged in learning because nobody would be learning something the same exact way. In the article it says that lessons are modified to fit every student using facial recognition, so students would be learning in a way that suites them personally. This technology also keeps students more engaged because they would feel happier, because the system tries to keep students engaged and happy.

9BEB8A30BE1B,"Conclusion.""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"", Rosenthal writes in ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"". By driving less, we can reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" by Robert Duffer, is a prime example of the reduction of air pollution after limiting car usage. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"", writes Duffer. One Friday, the smog of Paris ""rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"". On the following Monday, motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a $31 fine. After only one day with less cars on the roads, the smog had nearly dissappeared. This shows that even a day with less cars can make a huge difference in the amount of air pollution. Rosenthal's article, "" The End of Car Culture"", states that many sociologists believe that if the pattern of less cars continues, ""it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" because transortation is America's second largest sourse of carbon emissions. Less air polution is a very important advantage of less cars.

9F7BAFDB7636,"Conclusion.Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size. Venus is a planet in the solar system, it is the second planet from the sun. It has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. Venus is often referred to as Earth's twin, Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetory neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfric acid in venus's atmosphere.

The difference in speed means that sometimes we are closer to mars and other times to venus. Because Venus is something right around the corner in the space terms human have sent numerous space craft to land on the cloud-draped world. No space craft survived the landing for more than hours. Beyond high pressure and heat, venusian geology and weather present earthquakes, amd frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on it's surface. Venus has the hotest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though mercury is closer to our sun.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particular compelling idea for sending human to study venus. NASA's posible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the frays. Srriving to meet our challenge presented by venus has a big value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human currosity will likely lead us into manequally.

9F7BBA5FC646,"Conclusion.Teacher designed projects and student designed projects differ in many ways. This is mainly because students prefer to create projects based solely upon something they already enjoy and know.

9F7BBA5FC646,"Conclusion.A current event example that directly correlates to this problem is the phrase ""boomer."" This word is directed towards the Baby Boomer Generation and is used to describe the independent and self relying seniors who dont agree with the way the schooling system is operated. This generation lived in a time where authority was the key figure across the nation and it was not to be disrespected or major consequences would occur. ",3,2,74
9F7BBA5FC646,Concluding Statement.Teacher based projects prove to be superior according to many people. They are also a better learning tool and they create a more efficient learning environment for students. Without these projects students would be less obedient and wouldn't show as much respect to their authoritative figures. These projects are able to play a major factor in the curriculum taught by the schooling systems. And they are important to the growth of young individuals.Â  ,1,2,75
9F83C5864EB0,"Conclusion.Venus is same size in density, and size as Earth. The planet had rocky sediments, craters, valleys, and mountains. But nobody can visit or get a up close look to venus because it has a thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide, highly corrosive clouds of sulfuric acid in its atmosphere. The weather is extremely hot the average temperature is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit.

9F9FBC5BF6B3,"Conclusion.It is most logical and effective for a teacher to design summer projects. As the people who teach the class, teachers are the ones who will know what skills the students must practice in order to succeed in the class.

Therefore, there is no one better fit to prepare the students than the teacher. ",3,2,55
9F9FBC5BF6B3,"Conclusion.For example, a highly detailed and extensive project would indicate a rigorous class. The projects are an opportunity for teachers to introduce and exemplify the expectations of the students---in this case, high expectations. This sneak peek into class life would hopefully prevent unpreparedness from students and help the class run more smoothly. Teacher-designed projects have also been shown to benefit students by preventing a switch of classes during the school year: a junior at Generic_School decides to switch out of her Spanish 5 class during the summer after attempting the summer assignment. If it were designed by the teacher, it would be just like assignments from the class itself. This demonstrates the advantage of having the opportunity to work on an assignment that mirrors the work done in a possible class: a student essentially gains the ability to do a test run to see if they like it or not. That junior would have gotten stuck in the class and performed poorly if it were not for the summer assignment. Therefore, summer assignments should be designed by teachers to give students an idea of what to expect and what is expected of them. ",3,2,194

Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere. Venus has many more experinces to go and finding out more about it. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be exapned to meet very edges of imagination and innovation.

AE587E8BC0D3,"Conclusion.Advantages about limiting car usage. Really? I dont care about german suburb life without cars and i dont ever intend to care about it. i am a proud owner of a car and i dont want to live a life without it. This prompt is so unrelatable, mainly because

I OWN A CAR!

Maybe if i didnt i would be able to undertand this a little more but this is so ridiculous that i have to sit here and take time away from my education to write about cars. Im not even into cars. i dont care that people decide not to use cars, good for them, but i do use a car on a daily basis. im so over all of this excessive testing. Cars are pretty and nicely air conditioned, and shiny. They get you where you need to be quickly and you can jam out while on the way there. I hate essays, they are obnixious and boring. this is all a huge waste of time and i wish i just stayed home like some of the other kids in this class so that i wouldnt have to take this. Cars can be a nice way of driving around in money bags and showing everyone that you can afford this unnessacarily large vehicle that will sit in the hot room connected to your house, that also has a tempature very similar to hell. Honestlty your probably a really nice person who got stuck with the unfortunate job of reading all of these essays and grading them. You should be paid more because this just sucks, and im not even the one who has to read them all. You need to quit and go find some passion in your life. Take a painting class, or go watch the sunrise, you shouldnt be here reading all of these dumb essays that will never benefit my future or yours. ",3,1,320

In the classroom, an assignment is ruined when the students don't get to show their creativity and way of thinking. Teacher-designed projects make students think inside the box, and they are trapped with a specific set of rules that they cannot pass. Projects are meant to test the student on their knowledge on the subject, but most students only do the project for a passing grade and not for their own comprehension. Summer school projects should be student-designed because the students are able to form something in their own style, they would put in effort into something they are passionate about, and the teacher-designed projects are plain and disgusting. A teacher-designed project is a vanilla ice cream cone, while a student-designed project is an ice cream cone with nuts, chocolate syrup, and a cherry on top.Â  ",1,2,157

B0CA3173B40D,"Concluding Statement.Since teachers know the material they need to give students, have knowledge in project composition, and make challenges for the students, they should be constructing the summer assignments. They are the best fit for the role of educating and summer assignments are how students learn without the teacher. Teachers, creating the assignment, put their knowledge and experience into the assignment. Students do not have knowledge and experience teaching.

B3176BB24009,"Conclusion.In this article, the author includes, ""'Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional connection,' notes Dr. Huang. 'So computers need to understand that, too,'"" shows just how the students may become more engaged and interested in their classes that take up so much of their week days. (D'Alto 6). If the computers would be able to connect with the students, there is no reason that these kids would not feel more obligatred to pay attention and more interested to learn what is being taught.

Most likley the boat will smell like a barn full of anamils. Then you would also have to lift all that straw and bags of oat around the boat. You would have to clean up after them. I have 2 cats and I have to clean up after them and lift the bags of cat food. Boy let me you it is a hard job. But the worse part of taking care of my cats is when they get sick all over the floor.

So I dont really see why taking care of 100 some horses would be fun. unless you like horses. Then you would be working on the boat durring a war. that would be dangeras. Plus you would never be home to see your familay unless they came with you. But that probly wouldnt be allowed.

What if you get sea sick? Or a horse gets sick and spreds it around to the other horses? What if the boat springs a leak? A lot of lives will be at risk. Plus what if an animal that you are alergic to comes on the ship? What if the engine breaks and you cant move? Or you run out of food? What would you do? or if the lights quit working while your in the fog or its nigh, and your right in the middle of an ice berg feild? that would be a very rogh time. Or if some one needs medical attention what would you do? or if the caption got sickand it spreded around to the other crew members?

that would be a verytough time. Plus there would be noone to feed the horses becus evrey one would be to weak. ",3,1,309

Getting training lessons for the activity can be very expensive and a hard task to achieve. Also, their parents might want to use the money for other things that are important to them like a family vacation, or eating out. Lastly, they may be participating in an activity out of school that is expensive, and having to pay for both a school activity, and after school activity can be difficult. ",3,2,102

Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" It also states that "" On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahernheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own plantet.""

B6F03D0CEABE,"Conclusion.Students know their capabilities. During the summer some schools decide to make teacher give students summer projects, to help keep their mental capabilities up. While students may not like this whole process there has been discussion on whether or not they should be student or teacher designed.

B867F487B9F3,"Conclusion.Personal automobiles and cars have played a major role throughout the world since the invention of the car in World War 2. Cars have been a very successful invention and many people drive their own every day on their way to work, school or other places their feet cannot carry them. Though the car has fulfilled its duties in making the lives of humans easier, it has also contributed to many negative events. For example, car emissions get trapped in the atmosphere and cause living things to breathe in dirty air around them. ",4,2,94
B867F487B9F3,"Conclusion.Humans breathe in the gases that are polluting the air and can become sick from it. The environment suffers from the dirty air and may not be able to sustain life if there is not a stop to the large amounts of pollutants being emitted into the air. In the United States, passenger cars are the cause of ""up to 50 percent"" of greenhouse gas emissions while in Europe they are ""responsible for 12 percent"" (Rosenthal). This means that the car use in the United States is ruining the air around us and assists greatly in creating a disgusting environment. In popular and global cities, pollution is even more noticeable and overwhelming. For example, in Paris smog has become an everlasting issue. The climate in the area contributes to the smog filling the air along with the use of cars: ""Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions"" (Chicago Tribune). To reduce the smog in the area, an elaborate plan was taken into action. Cars with even license plates could not drive on certain days and cars with odd license plates could not drive on the other days. By doing this, the air in Paris cleared up dramtically. Therefore by promoting a system where car usage is not as common, the environment can become healthier and cleaner, which benefits the citizens of the Earth. ",3,2,232
B867F487B9F3,"Conclusion.Those who live in car-free communities discover new ways to reach the destinations they have reach throughout the day. Some will utilize their body and take advantage of nature by biking or walking from one place or another. Others might us public transportation or will car-pool with those who do own a car. As previously mentioned before, Colombia participates in a car free day, which means ""Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses"" to get where they needed to be (Selsky). Their use of other means of transportation on the day without cars, exemplifies that it is possible to live using other ways to get around. Some people are against the idea of using other transportation, but if they were to see the impact the alternatives have, they would be more accepting. These days many young people tend to get their license later by waiting until they reach their twenties, suggesting that they can live a happy life without relying on a personal automobile. Instead of using their own cars, they find other ways to get to work or school. These people become acclimated to organizing their lives ""around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends"" (Rosenthal). Younger people who commit their lives to walking or public transportation, become aware of the fact that driving a machine that can negatively affect the world is not a necessity. Their awareness then can continue passing on to each generation and can ultimately prevent the excessive use of cars throughout the world. ",3,2,255

B8EAF80A1409,Conclusion.teachers should ultimately design summer work ,5,0,7
B8EAF80A1409,Conclusion.Some people believe that summer projects should be student-designed so that students are not overly stressed during their vacation time. ,2,2,21
B8EAF80A1409,"Conclusion.Psychologist Erik Erickson developed the eight significant psycho socialÂ stages that outline the common conflicts experienced throughout a lifetime. In his seventh stage, known as ""integrity vs. despair,"" he describes the adulthood stage when people look back on their life. Many adults in this stage scroll through their overall progress and accomplishments. They decide if they spent their time wisely and lived a fulfilling life. If they look back at life and conclude that it was spent efficiently, they experience a sense of integrity. On the other hand, if they feel as if they did not make the most of their time on earth, they develop a terrible feeling of despair. It is important that students, being at such a young age, recognize the value of time. Although everyone remembers the saying ""life is short,"" many people forget to practice what they preach. If students are given teacher-designed projects, this will ensure that they efficiently spend their time during summer break. 
",3,2,164
B8EAF80A1409,"Conclusion.In other words, the work assigned will be less surprising because students have already completed projects from their teachers. In the novel, ""I Am Malala,"" Malala's father prepares her to be a successful public speaker. At first Malala was not very good at speaking in front of a big audience, but he worked with her everyday to build her knowledge and improve her skills. Eventually, she became one of the most influential activists ever to exist. She is able to addressÂ important topics, such as women's rights, in ways that she never could before. Through proper preparation, her weak public speaking turned into her greatest strength. This proves that goals are met when students can connect with their mentors. Students must be given the chance to build a relationship with their teachers. If summer projects are teacher-designed, this will allow students to email their teachers with questions about the assignments. This will not only generate a strong relationship, but it will also prepare students for the style of teaching they will soon face at school. ",3,2,177
B90C8C40C0A0,"Conclusion.Summer projects are immensely helpful in order to keep your mind active and intelligent when your're not in school, constantly stimulated by academic subjects. ",4,0,25

B90C8C40C0A0,"Conclusion.In order to be most successful, students should have authority to be creative and responsible for their summer projects. ",0,2,20
B90C8C40C0A0,"Conclusion.Throughout my school years, I find myself stressed and concerned every year when I receive a new teacher, after a long and carefree summer. The teachers have so much faith in their coworkers and the retention of the knowledge that according to them ""we should have learned in years past."" They begin to assign ""easy"" and ""refresher"" work that they assume we have been taught. The lack of communication between teachers is a hard burden on students due to their past teachers exclaiming that ""you do not need to worry about that, your teacher next year will teach you,"" and your present teachers thinking that you had already learned it in your past courses. As the student, you are left with the sense of delusion and dissatisfaction on why you lack this important skill and learning target. You struggle to understand basic fundamentals of learning and when you are assigned a project you begin to sweat the little gaps in your learning. Every student knows this feeling of remorse of being assigned a project on material you just havent been taught yet. Students who design the projects know what they and their peers have been taught and what they all lack because they have all endured the same classes and teachers. ",3,2,214
B90C8C40C0A0,"Conclusion.The creativity of generation Z is outstanding and unique to modern day society. The opportunity for students to create the projects would be extraordinary and expressive of our generation. The use of creativity is very limited in school. You are to be complacent with the standards of your school through the strict rules and regulations they place. Many of the rules you are given are not only rigid but not needed. Teachers set boundaries on students and rarely let them experienceÂ and express their own style and flair. When students are allowed to indulge in their personal ambiance their limits are endless. This is embodied through art and the publishing of students in modern day. More books written by teenagers are selling on the shelves today, than ever before. ",3,2,130

Apperently, around 4,000 drivers were fined, and around twenty-seven cars were impounded to the people that had attitudes or strong reaction to there fine. Now in my opinion, do you seriously want to get risked and get your car taken away or pay a fine? Most likely no right?

Not only did this limit my creativity, it also limited my self identity because I was unable to express myself in what clothes I wear. This so called favor that my parents would do for me caused me to never learn how to dress myself in a reasonable fashion for the appropriate setting. Just like how the students will never know how to design their own projects if the teachers do not put any faith in the students for just this one summer. The teachers will be able to see a students best representation of his or hers creativity and level of learning because they will have something to prove to society. To show everyone that they are able to do things on their own or independently ",3,2,181
BB5B7EE4A1A6,"Conclusion.The students need to have the teachers and society's trust to exceed what is expected of them because society will never know what these students are capable of if they are never given an opportunity to prove themselves. This will better the generations reputation if done correctly. 
",0,2,48
BB5B7EE4A1A6,"Conclusion.However, even if the students fail at this task they will learn from the failure. They learn what they did wrong in order to develop more skills and when the next opportunity comes they will not fail. Either way fail or succeed the students learn different types of independent life skills that are very valuable and needed for adult life. ",6,2,61
BBDD46456082,Conclusion.Venus is different from Earth but it is the same in some way. It is differnt because of the tempurature and the atmosphere and the surface. The tempurature reaches up to 800 degrees fahrenheit and that is unsurvivable for humans. The surface is bad to it is a hot lava and molten like suface and it can melt most metals. Venuses atmosphere is mainly filled with 97 percent of carbon dioxide. The air pressure is really bad it is strong enough it could crush a submarine like its going down to the deepest part of our oceans. NASA is trying to come up with a way to study Venus with a blimp like vehicle that can float 30 miles up away from Venus and its nasty surface and atmosphere. Even though the tempurature will reach only 170 degrees fahrenhite it is still survivable for humans.       ,3,1,146
BBE1713D653B,"Conclusion.A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus, its even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric aciod in venus's atmosphere. it is usually 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and sometimes the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experince on our own planet. All thought these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth.

Also venus has the hottest surface temperture of any planet in our solar system. Even though mercury is closer to our sun. Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcannoes powerful earthquakes are frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

NASA is working on other approaches to studying venus. For an example some simplified electronics made of slilcon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. These devices were first envisioned in 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during world war II. Modern computers exidting in those days may sound schoking but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all.

Striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value not only because pf the insight to be gained on the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. ",3,1,232

BDC4070CF21E,"Concluding Statement.I believe that students should be able to design their own summer assignments because, they are the only ones capable of knowing what they personally need to improve on, teachers may try to take advantage of the summer assignment and assign too much work, and everyone learns differently so students should be able to tailor the summer assignment to fit their learning styles.

BDCD981437BB,"Conclusion.A great example of this circumstance would be from the book

Divergent , written by Veronica Ross. In this novel, the main character, Tris, undergoes a significant change in her life; switching factions. The system does not choose for the individuals, every individual has the right to choose accordingly amongÂ a set of factions. The ability that one has to make the decision for themselves allows them to be comfortable with a future lifestyle that results in new friends, family, and the way of life. Students being able to personalize how they are going to perform the project, whether or not it will involve partners, and the form of work given will result in students being at a higher level of comfort than if a teacher were to produce the project top to bottom, not knowing if students will be satisfied or comfortable. ",3,2,143
BDCD981437BB,"Conclusion.Summer break is called a break for a reason, and if teachers assign projects that are more time consuming than anticipated, the time that students are given would be wasted. For example, an individual that brings similarity to the topic is Frederick Douglass. Frederick Douglass is an inspirational figure in America's History. The man wants the abolition of slavery. By fighting for his beliefs and going through excruciating pain by his slaveholders, Douglass becomes more and more passionate about gaining the freedom that the man and every other slave deserves. With the ability to control one's own life and decisions, one will have more freedom and space to breathe. Giving students the opportunity to customize the projects to a more time conservative approach aids in both the learning experience because the work is still getting done accordingly, and there is still time reserved for a summer break that the students deserve and should be able to fully enjoy. 
",3,2,159
BDCD981437BB,"Concluding Statement.projects given during the summer should be designed by the students themselves because students then have the ability to work with material that best fits their comfort zone, customize a satisfactory project that persuades students to being more eager to complete it, and have the ability to make projects that consume less time, providing a larger window for students to use for summer activities. Students should be able to have freedom when it comes to their summer, and if given the opportunity to customize the work they receive during this time period, the results would be nowhere near disappointing. Making summer projects student-designed is a must.Â  ",1,2,108
BE243683124A,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion, some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Students do not need projects over summer break because students will forget and will become stressed out, students may have other summer actives planned, and all in all students just need a break from learning.I personal feel like students learn enough in the 11 month that they are in school.

C05809232F0E,"Conclusion.I believe that while the answer is not simple, students should overwhelmingly be in charge in terms of the creation of these assignments, ",5,2,24
C05809232F0E,"Conclusion.This issue is seen extensively with the summer assignments for harder classes, as students may be looking to improve in a subject area or challenge them self, but not have the proper knowledge or skill set to properly learn the content that the teacher wants them to know. For example, a friend of mine wanted to take AP US History this year, but had taken only Academic World History last year. When it came time to complete the AP US History summer assignment, he was out of his depth and did not understand how to properly outline the chapters that we had to read. If we let students design these summer assignments, it will be easier for these kids to access new material and challenge themselves while expanding their knowledge, without overwhelming them. ",3,2,134
C05809232F0E,"Concluding Statement.I believe that it is a long awaited and necessary change for these summer assignments to become student created and designed, rather than entirely fabricated and mandated by the teachers. It is necessary because not only will it help kids to learn in the different ways that suit and engage them best, but also to help students who have less experience in the subject or who are trying to challenge themselves and find themselves frustrated at the restrictions and requirements of the summer assignment. Added to that, a student driven summer assignment will allow kids to more thoroughly enjoy and become engaged in their learning by allowing them to pursue their passions and interest in relation to that topic, and express themselves through learning in unique ways.

C4C3A58C5939,"Conclusion.Since venus is so close to it makes it the second hottest planet in space. Its hard for them to examine it closely because how hot it could be on the planet so the sit safe at a certain vantage point.

Venus is close to earth witch makes itthe twin like in terms of density and size its close but distant a little from venus. So say if we get close to the sun earth woukd basically be like venus. Venus and earth is right around the corner from eachother so wat makes it different from eachother shouldnt the earth be hot too. To really think about it hot would it be if we were like venus.

The atmosphere is 97 perdent of carbon dioxide blankets venus which could really explain where the heat come from or take place in. Theres acid in venus atmosphere the pressure is 90 times worst than what it would usally be on earth. Its over 800 degress on that plante which makes it a baby sum or the son of sun.

C51752A9035C,"Conclusion.It really depends on the students schedules, for example, if a student works on a student designed project, and plays a sport in the summer like for instance soccer, the work could easily be completed if the student balances his or her time wisely, maybe playing soccer like at nine fifty in the morning, and working on the student designed project at one fifty in the afternoon, could balance the students time easily. Another example on how students wouldn't have to worry about time management is that, students could also make time to spend time with their families, if they ever plan on going to their cousins birthday, or go to their brothers or sisters sport games, students can choose what times work for them, and their work would have to be their second priority. ",3,2,136
C51752A9035C,"Conclusion.When students make work for themselves, they tend to understand what their own assignment or tasks mean to themselves. For example, students can make their own projects by using websites such as adobe spark or prezi. com , and can also make their own projects on Google PowerPoint. if the student knows how he or she could benefit themselves on making their own work, then the students can accomplish on being their own teacher. Another example on how the work wouldn't be the issue, is that the work itself would not be difficult to get done. when students make their own work, it may not have the same work level like a teachers work, but it can still be educational and it can be easier. If a student designed project was created on Google PowerPoint, then that would not be difficult to get done. ",3,2,144
C51752A9035C,"Concluding Statement., even if teacher designed projects could also be beneficial to a certain group of students, the knowledge being given to the students mind won't make as much of an impact as a student designed project would. People tend to forget that not all teenagers come from the same mentality of not being hard workers or not smart enough, every person in this world has their own intelligence within themselves, people just tend to forget and start to believe that they don't have a smart mentality. If teachers can have enough trust in their students and be willing to ask them for help, then that should be a sign that summer projects can be student designed. Therefore, if there are not enough teachers who can help make the projects for students in the summer, then students can try to help with that if they want to. ",1,0,147
C5A3278EB458,"Conclusion.The students have common interest so they can talk to others and make friends. An extracurricular activity would be good for a shy student so they can get out of their comfort zone in a small group of people. Students can learn to share their ideas in an extracurricular activity because it is a small group and them they can get more comfortable to do it normal school.

C7FA88E9DF3B,"Conclusion.For example, in elementary school, students come up with their own experiments to test, after which they present their findings at the science fair. By doing so, students learn how to depend on themselves to find information. Similarly, sophomores at the Generic_School take a research class. They work on a wide variety of projects that are mostly assigned by teachers, but towards the end of the year, they must come up with an independent research project that they will work on in their junior year. In order to choose their project, students have to conduct extensive research to understand the topic, as their project cannot have been done before. Additionally, they have to continue conducting research in junior year to allow for a wider understanding of the topic. This allows the students to be self-reliant, as they know more about their project than their teacher, who acts as a mentor. Self-reliance is a very important skill that helps people succeed in the community and workplace when they become an adult, so it is important to establish the skill early on. ",3,2,181

CA5DB05415A5,Conclusion.It has become a common practice today for many people to use their phones while driving. They try to be as efficient as possible with their time and see no problem with trying to multitask when operating a vehicle. Some text on their phones while others may take calls or check emails. ,4,0,53
CA5DB05415A5,Conclusion.Often times crashes are the result of distracted driving. ,0,0,10
CA5DB05415A5,"Conclusion.This usually occurs in teenage age groups who have a commitment to checking their phones while driving. Teenagers assume that by taking their eyes off of the road for solely two seconds, they aren't putting themselves or anyone else in danger. In reality, distracted driving via cell phone use ""reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent,"" (""Cell Phones""). Taking calls or texting confidently reduces a driver's ability to control a vehicle, respond to driving events, and direct attention to the roadway. This isn't the case for just teenagers. These conditions apply to every driver who attempts to use their cell phone while driving, thus creating a dangerous driving environment. People often drive with family members, close friends, or children in the car. The chance of a fatal crash because of distracted driving is high and it is very possible that these family members, close friends, and children could be injured or worse. It is much safer to restrict all phone use while driving in order to ensure that roadways remain safe. By not using a cell phone, a driver is better able to pay attention, less likely to crash, and following the law (""Cell Phones""). ",3,2,202
CA5DB05415A5,"Conclusion.For instance, Georgia enacted Joshua's Law in 2007 requiring 16 year old drivers to complete driver's ed. The state also recently approved the Hands-Free law, which in essence eliminated any and all distracted driving practices. States recognize the problems that come with cell phone use while driving and have taken steps to fix them. This is evidence enough that in no way, shape, or form should drivers be allowed to use cell phones while operating a vehicle. For further support, there are about 9 people killed and 1,000 injured daily in the United States because of distracted driving (""The Dangers of Distracted Driving""), thus the popularity of cell phone use while driving is a damaging practice in the U.S. and should be ended immediately. ",3,2,127
CA5DB05415A5,"Conclusion.it is a more viable and safe practice to prohibit its use until a person it not behind the wheel of a vehicle. A person only puts themselves in more danger, even when doing something appropriate with a cellphone when operating a vehicle, by trying to utilize it and maintain focus on the road at the same time. ",6,2,59
CA5DB05415A5,"Concluding Statement.In sum, it is in the most obvious interest of all drivers that cell phone use while driving be prohibited in any way or form. It is a dangerous practice that puts family, kids, and friends in immediate danger. Any benefits that are noted of cell phone use while driving are miniscule compared to the risk one takes by even looking at a phone for two seconds. Considering states have had enough common sense to begin a prohibition of the practice in favor of all drivers' safety, it is more than adequate to say that drivers should in no manner be given the opportunity to contribute a fatal driving environment by using a cell phone.

CAC4E6021973,"Conclusion.Keeping students on a leash forces them to wear a one size fits all education. Each student is different; they all have different strengths, different weaknesses, different motivations, and different goals. That is why we need to give them tailored education. Giving students this freedom would allow them to create a project that works well for them, and more importantly on a topic they are actually interested in. If we let students do a topic they enjoy, the results will be far better compared to when they are forced to learn about something they have no long termÂ interest in. The freedom students gain from designing their own projects is far more valuable than just following the directions their teachers gave them. ",3,2,123
CAC4E6021973,"Conclusion.Arguably, the most valuable skill in today's society is the ability to be able to bring a new unique perspective and thought process to any discussion. That is not a skill that can be obtained by constantly being told what to do and how to do it. Students need to learn for themselves how to go to the drawing board, find out which ideas are bad, which ones are good, and then create a plan to execute the good ones. That is not something that can be spoon fed in the classroom. That's why student designed summer projects are the perfect opportunity for schools to do their part in teaching students how to think creatively. ",3,2,116
CAC4E6021973,Conclusion.When forced to come up with their own ideas and think creatively students will develop and enhance skills they would have never had the teacher been the one designing the project. ,0,2,32

That is, until your parents get the email from your teachers explaining the project you have to do this summer.

Looking back at things now, if it wasnt for those summer projects then I wouldnt have been as prepared as I have been to proceed onto the next grade level. Students tried to protest against not having summer projects at all, but that idea was shut down fast. Instead, the board of education agreed to hold a national vote on whether or not the summer projects should be student based or teacher based. If the projects are teacher based students wouldnt slack in order to get the project done they will actually complete it and teachers are trying to prepare you, they know the material best and are trying to provide materials they know you will need in orderÂ to be successful this coming year.

CFA591751173,"Conclusion.To start, NASA has taken recent picture of Cydonia in 2001 that shows it is just a natural landform that has developed on the Red Planet Mars. ""On April 8. 2001--a cloudless summer day in Cydonia--Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look.

D18B9F0D2CB4,"Conclusion.""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (5). In other words, cars are higly responsible for the harmful gases that pollute our atmosphere and cause global warming. In Paris,Â  a partial driving ban was issued to clear the air after days of high air pollution rates. After the driving ban, ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after five-days of intensifying smog"" (14). By using cars less, citizens can reduce pollution and help keep our earth clean and safe. Statisticts show that fewer peopleÂ  are using cars around the world. ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009"" (41). Sociologists belive that this trend will continue and possibly increase. They belive it will ""have benficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions"" (34). ",3,2,165

There is a boy at my school that we are going to call Generic_Name. Generic_Name does not understand the WWI subjets in his history class. He's been doing his class and homework, been paying attention, he's been writing his notes, but he still does not understand the subject. He's asked his teacher for extra help and has recieved it. While his knowledge for the unit is growing, he still just barely passes his Standards of Learning test with a 401. Over the summer, his school required all students to make up their own project about anything they may have learned. At first he did not think it was going to help him but he decides to give it a try anyway.

Nobody in the world wants to wash summer away with book workÂ from the class they don't like.

Students, for the most part, do not generally enjoy reading pages on pages on pages; however, if a teacher gives a blank statement about what to do, the readings become difficult for the student to comprehend. In a students mind, it can go many different ways to think about a project. Having a teacher design a project base gives the student more to go off of instead of a teacher saying ""Read these pages and submit a project by the beginning of the school year"" is not helpful. By giving a foundation of the project, the student can succeed and be more efficient. ",3,2,134

If it were to be the opposite and were to be student based, it would have had a fifty to fifty chance of it having a good or bad project that could not meet requirements, wasted time, and did not get the point of the project. The sole reason of a summer project is to show a student learning, if the project was not good, the project had no affect on the students learning.Â  ",1,2,124

World War II had just been in Europe, but was now over. Many comturies were left in ruins. These contries needed animals and livestock to survive. The UNRRA hired seagoing cowboys to take care of the livestock on the boats when they were being shipped to a certain part of the world to another. Luke and his friend wanted to care and help, so they signed up for seagoing cowboys program.

Luke had turned 18 upon the first trip, which meant he could be drafted for the army. His draft amnagement company had learned he was in the seagoing cowboys, and they told him to keep doing what he was doing, because it was a form of help.

Sometimesthe weather was bad upon the boats, and sometimes it was good. When it was bad, members upon the boat would participate in watching the storms. One night Luke had watch, he got into a bad accident that left him without work for a couple days due to broken ribs. When the weather was good, and all the chores were done for the day, the men upon the ship had time to play games or travel to see things. The animals are what kept Luke busy though.

In Europe passenger cars are reponsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States.

The face starred in a Hollywood film, and appeared in books. NASA argues that they need to get the information out to people.

DA6449D7D94A,"Conclusion.Both seem to resemble a simple mesa, a natural landform quite common on Mars. The 1998 photograph was slightly blurry, so three years later Michael Malin and his crew returned to the Red Planet, to the Cydonia region. Mr. Malin set the Mars Global Surveyor camera to maximum resolution, and snapped an excellent picture from above the Face. And, going even further, I will point out that each pixel in the 2001 photograph spans1.56 meters, as the Viking I's 1976 photo spans 43 meters per pixel. As you can see, this is a significant difference and must not be overlooked. ",3,2,102

DABEF78A3A24,"Conclusion.Conducting research requires numerous forms of evidence, samples, test, etc. In paragraph 5, the author makes suggestions of creating a spacecraft to sustain temperatures of at least 170 degrees Fahrenheit and levitating thirty-plus miles over the surface to observe the planet. Although this may be the most safest and efficient approach, he even stated that it would require getting ""up close and personal"" to collect samples. The whole idea is to reach Venus and collect data to compare to Earth and Venus' previous history. ",3,2,85

E0243DB9F8D2,Concluding Statement.In my case I still prove this to be an alien. We've done plenty of research and nothing has been found is it is a human face or an alien. My question is if that it was a human why wouldn't have we known it was a human if it died. Where'd the rest of their body go? Perhaps it was trapped under the surface but in no question I still believe this is an artifact of an alien. ,1,0,81
E04E83CEF5DA,"Conclusion.I get the person that trying to state there claim is trying to give us evidence and examples. In paragraph four it's telling us that when the software is tracking the persons emotion it shows them how many emotions they feel even if there mixed which agin doesn't make no sence for me because you can totally know or tell just by the person face expressing they do. In the very top off the article of mona lisa's picture you can totally see thats shes happy,ferful. And i only looked at the picture for some secounds which makes no sence of why i'll need a device to tell me how she feels. In paragraph six it's showing us that if your in a classroom confuse a teacher can stop the lesson and tell you which part you don't get .

Teacher-designed projects are also a way for students to get a taste of what the following school year is going to be like, which can give them a head start. Lastly, if students designed their own projects, the chances of it being organized is slim-to-none; whereas, if teachers designed the projects, it would have a purpose, a flow, and be well organized all at the same time.

The article says a computer will be able to detect if a student is bored, but teachers have that ability already, minus the cost and invasion of privacy. Teachers are in the classroom so that they can make those personal connections with each student and ensure that they are doing everything they can to provide the best education possible. If a computer detects boredom it will just try another lesson without knowing what is best for the student.

E36560297AD9,"Conclusion.Teachers have lots of experience with helping students create summer projects, therefore, should be the people who organize them. While the work may seem tedious and difficult at times, teachers are simply just trying to assist in helping you gain the knowledge and understand it. By giving students a lot of work, teachers are helping them learn not only the information being attained from the project but also, how to manage their time efficiently. Teachers understand that when students are working in a time frame, they have a better understanding of how to manage their time to work efficiently and get everything done before the due date. Experienced teachers can guide students in how to manage their time, get everything done, and still have time to spare. It is because of experienced teachers that students have been able to construct outstanding summer projects. ",3,2,144
E36560297AD9,"Conclusion.If a student is engaged, they are more likely to succeed. Teachers engage students by designing summer projects in a way that interests them. A student who is engaged in their project is more likely to receive a good grade than a student who showed no interest in it at all. Teachers typically try to stick to things that inspire all students equally, they try not to lean towards a specific influence as to remain unbiased. Students have many different interests which is why student-organized projects would be beneficial. A teacher with a good understanding of their student's likes and dislikes can better organize a project that will help students be engaged. Keeping students engaged is a difficult, but manageable, task and while not every teacher can do it, they all try. ",3,2,133

E4CE3E508B44,"Conclusion.NASA would have came out and said it already. There is no way we can actually prove that is actually an alien. But, we have classified it as a landform. We even have other landforms on earth to compre it too. Many say it is equivalent to a butte or mesa(many things found in the American Mest).

E5856BB0C34A,"Conclusion.When,

NASA unveiled the image for all to see, the caption noted a ""huge rock formation, which resembles a human head, formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.

Though, When Mars Global Surveryor flew over the Cydonia for the first time, Michael and his Mars Obiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all

For example: As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see where they were."" The picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. ",3,1,171

E5B076EB95A7,"Conclusion.They only took pictures of the face.

No one went down on mars to examine or observe the face. An example for this would be that the passage says"" only this one had unusual shadws that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh"". This example shows that if it looks like a Egyptian Pharaoh how would the aliens know about it? ",3,0,62

E88DDA2FB4EA,"Conclusion.
Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because off the insight to eb gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

EB3398FD0FF5,Conclusion.All astronomers and explorers are well aware of all of the challenging conditions such as the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere and the atmospheric pressure being 90 times greater in Venus than the pressure in Earth. These are not the only challenging conditions; another dangerous feature is that temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit in Venus's surface. ,3,0,62
EB3398FD0FF5,"Conclusion.The plan for sending people to study Venus would not give the necessary information to be properly informed of this volatile planet. All of these obstacles are not enough to calm human's desire of knowledge about unearthly topics. In paragraph eight, the author says that all of the challenges are not enough to mellow down our curiosity enough to quit studying Venus. ",3,0,63
EB3398FD0FF5,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion, the claim about Venus being a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents that the author of ""The Challenges of Exploring Venus"" states is well supported by facts and perfectly thought out ideas. Although Venus is an extremely dangerous planet packed with many reasons as to why exploration is currently held back, NASA is still looking for ways to be able to gain more valuable insight about the Evening Star. Just like the author said, learning and travelling should not be limited by doubts, and scientists will not let doubts and fears stop them. ",1,2,98

EB763115B6CD,"Conclusion.They may fail to give the proper signals, miss road signs, change lanes abruptly or respond slowly to hazards. Erratic driving patterns can be extremely dangerous to everyone else on the road, including other drivers, pedestrians, and animals. Also, motorist involved in a stressful or emotional phone conversation may exhibit aggressive behavior while they drive, such as road rage. This may cause the erratic driving to worsen and this greatly increases the chance of causing an accident.

We started planning one day, and remembering what we've learned over the past year. The thing she remembered most was in her history class, her teacher taught her something valuable and it was "" You work hard enough, you can achieve anything in the world."" That stuck with her for 5 years and she still remembered it. So for her project she did something based on that quote.

That is like saying that weather guy like oh well its gonna be 60% chance of rain and thunderstorm here in the mid east of country no no not it all all because the weather guy only gets stuff right 80%-90% of weather right shoot weather people struggle to predict indiana weather because one season supposed be harsh and deadly potentional winter right while we may have that but like one day it wants be 60 degress fariheit like no its not supposed be that warm in indiana in winter when we think winter we think snow, hail ,snow storms , chilly winds any type extreme colds but warmth no no not at all partly cloudy ok sure some sunshine with cold windchill sure but extreme odd warmth for time of winter no ",3,0,193

The advantages are much greater than the dangers. If they are successful then there will be another planet for people to live on. The similar weather conditions is a tremendous advantage. There being water already on the planet and the possibility of living organisms being on the planet shoes that it is possible. The possibilty of something great over rules the possibility failing. If the astronomers give up and say that the dangers are to big then they will never know if the dangers were not defeatable or not.

F2C57EEEF02C,"Conclusion.This topic of creativity is important because it is what separates peers from each other so that not one person is the same. Each student has their own style that is different from those around which is what makes them unique. When student driven projects are created, it forces those who complete the project to think outside of the box. This is significant because it is what grows the knowledge of each student; by doing this they are learning the new material as the project is being completed. By implementing these sort of projects the students creativity is apparent because teachers are not giving the student the task; rather the student is the one designing and completing the assignment all on their own. Creativity is an essential piece to the puzzle of learning for children and by creating student-designed projects, each child will benefit across the board. ",3,2,148

-

Earth, Venus, and Mars are our other planetary neighbor, they orbit in a different speeds. there is a time when Mars is getting closer to our planet Earth and there is a time when Venus is getting closer to the Earth.

Often Venus referred to as Earth's twin because Venus is the closest planet to

Earth in a size and occasionlly the closest in distance.

Like other planets have atmosphere and different temperture, Venus also have atmospere and differents temperture. When a spaceship when to Venus it couldn't survived the landing for more than a few hours because unlike Venus's surface is hottest in our solar system even though Mercury is closer to our sun.

F4A3B4B14952,Conclusion.After the long school year the last thing a student wants to do is more work. If a student was to design their own project it probably would not be helpful. A teacher is able to access what is necessary to learn before the class starts and they will be able to create a project that is nothing but beneficial. In my own past experiences the summer projects have never been very difficult but they have required a small amount of my time and energy. When these projects were spread out I was able to complete them well and they helped me. I have never had a project assigned to me over the summer months that was necessarily difficult and I have never received a large amount of them at the same time. It is usually only required by a few core classes and it is not difficult to complete them. The only thing they really require is the time. They need to e done in a timely manor and done to the best ability to prepare for the next year. ,3,0,182
F4A3B4B14952,"Conclusion.Managing time is one of the most important, yet difficult portion of a summer project but it is also something that is very difficult. Not only is it important for that summer project but those time management skills carry over into the coming school year. A project that is designed by a student may not properly prepare you for the rigor of the curriculum that is to come or the amount of time that is necessary for the class. A teacher creating a project will be able to demonstrate how much time the student will need to put in for their class in the upcoming year. If a student is able to manage their time well during the summer months when there is always something better to do then they will be able to manage all of their classes and those course loads better. They will have a better idea of what they need to do to succeed in the next school year. 
",3,0,164
F4A3B4B14952,Conclusion.Honestly I do not trust myself enough to create a well thought out project for myself without cutting myself some slack. I would much rather have a teacher give me the assignment and complete it to the best of my abilities. ,0,2,42

While children are allowed a three-month break, during college, a student is no longer under the control of their guardians. Most college students don't get their parents to pay for their all of their supplies anymore. Reciving summer work is just a small step to the upcoming constant work of employees.

F776F9881474,Conclusion.I know for a fact that if I was to get a summer project it would not most likely not get done but if I had a choice to pick it or have my teacher pick it I would pick it my self any day of the week. If I would was to choose my own summer project then I am almost 100% sure most kids would like to pick their own summer project. Just like 2 summers ago I had to go to summer school because I was not doing so good in my cases and the teacher said that all we had to do was a project and we wouldÂ be all good and we will be ok to go to the next grade so I was relived so I went home and got started on it but when I got started I realized that it was boring and if something was boring I was probaly not going to get it done. ,3,0,165

The author creates a great danger of being on this planet by giving us details on what is highly destructive in the planets atmosphere. Studying in Venus may be worth it for the data but very destructive and harmful to the human culture/nature.

Sadly, another team beat them, but my mom learned something very important that day. She learned that it was okay to loose, and how to accept that it will happen again in the future. Ever since then, when she lost something, she accepted it, and wasn't upset. My friend Generic_Name, from elementary school used to do track with me, but moved onto another sport. She was unbareably talented, and was as fast as a cheetah. When she won her first championship, she learned how to be humble, and learned not to think that she was better than anyone else on our team just because she won the championship. She didn't just do that though, she was able to encourage other people on the team to be humble as well, and not to brag if you did really good on something. In later situations, she knew not to brag or boast about the fact that she did better than someone else. Doing an activity helps people be better, and could help the students of the school be better as well. ",3,2,200

F8C22ACD1774,"Conclusion.Swimming in the ocean, getting a tan, boating, and fishing are all exciting activities for the summer; in contrast, a school project is not, especially one without clear instructions.

A school project that is completely student-designed is unfathomable for many Elementary, Middle, or High School students because of the stress it would create during a time of recovery.

Many teachers give summer assignments, but allow for students toÂ do the work, that was required to be completed over the summer, during the school year.

Although projects with specific instructions by the teacher can be tedious, many could argue that coming up with a rubric for ones self would be of greater difficulty.

In the event that schools make summer projects mandatory, it is the responsibility of teachers to make sure students learn necessary information and achieve the goals of the project. ",4,2,142
F8C22ACD1774,"Conclusion.Many students would jump at the opportunity to get ahead on the information for the next school year and many may not enjoy the requirement, but appreciate the opportunity.

Giving clear instructions provides the structure to learn and get ahead before the race for grades begins.

A summer project in which the students are designing and planning does not insure they will continue to learn during their break, but instead assures teachers that students will attempt to make it as non complexÂ and superficial for themselves as possible.

Providing students with the opportunity to design their project uniquelyÂ with no specifications needed enables them to be lazy in the creation of the project and miss critical information for the subject that the project is on.

Students come up with many ways to avoid in depth descriptions of a topic because of the lack of motivation to do so.

With clear instructions, students will be able to find the information the teacher wants and needs in order to grade the project, and the information needed to elaborate on this knowledge in the beginning of the school year.

Students want the ability to enjoy the summer and with the specific necessities for the summer project highlighted, they will not have the stress of creating a project from scratch. ",3,2,217

F9238D9E5631,"Conclusion.students would be practicing for a future of independence, where they would be the main person dictating what their work should reflect. Students would have to practice planning ahead to ensure their work reflects their full potential, rather than rushing into work and creating something sub par. Another positive related to student-planned projects is that students would be more prepared for future experiences. Students would have an opportunity to lightly touch on skills required throughout adulthood and outside of school. They would be practicing time management as they plan for their project within their own schedule. Students would also be practicing self-reliance as their project would be fully based on their own efforts.Â Further, a student-designed project would reflect the student by what work they present.Â By choosing what they create, the student's the effort and energy put into the project would be represented in their work. It also shows their own work ethic, as the quality of the project would highlight how much they valued completing the project in a well-reflected manner. ",3,2,174

F955CE7D650C,"Conclusion.Students know how much work they are able to do as well as the skill level required for their project. When students create their own projects its always going to be able something they enjoy, making it easier for them to do the project and be held accountable for it. Students are also able to create their own project knowing they are being graded not on the standard for everyone else but the standard for themselves. This takes a lot of pressure off of students as they feel like they will be graded fairly as long as long as they do as much as they are capable of doing and do it well. If the student does not complete the project for whatever reason it is much easier for them to be held accountable for it, as excuses like ""I didnt understand"" or ""It was to hard for me"" will become invalid because they are the ones who create the project. Thus making it clear that student designed projects will benefit everyone and insure work is being down. ",3,2,179
F955CE7D650C,Conclusion.Although what people with these beliefs fail to realize is that teachers are humans too and they get tired. Teachers wait for the summer to come just as much as students and to have them create an entirely new project towards the end of the year can be very tiring after having a year full of creating assignments. When the students create their own summer project it allows for teachers to be able to relax and take some weight off their shoulders as the day until summer slowing come. ,6,2,90
F955CE7D650C,Concluding Statement.All in all student should be given the opportunity to create their own summer projects. This because students will create something they enjoy and will do. It will also give teachers with one less project to make. After all why take the hard way when allowing the students to design the project themselves can be just efficient with less work for both students and teachers. That is exactly why students should be allowed to create their own summer projects. At the end of the day everyone just wants to enjoy their summer the best way possible.Â  ,1,2,98

He first worked at a grocery store and and the bank. When his friend invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. He couldnt say no. So then he went.

He had graduated from high school and had 2 jobs but whem his friend invited him to Europe his whole llife had changed. Since there was a war he went to go help out. He and Don had signed up to be a segoing cowboy. 44 nations joined toggether and formed a UNNRA and he was hired to be a seagoing cowboy. That when you have to take care of horses , mules adnd young cows. That was his job over there in Europe.

He kept going there and he kept helping others. He like his job. The cattle boats were unbelievable for a small town boy it had said. He really enjoyed his job. He toured lots of places like Venice Italy and a city with streets of water. But Luke had made 9 trpis the most of any seagoing cowboy. He traveled across the atlantic ocean and it took him about 2 weeks.

He was taking care of lots of animals and was feeding them 2 or 3 times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats. They had to be pulled. He had helped out his aunt Katie as a boy.

In the city of Paris after days of pollution they made a ban on driving to fix the smog.

On mondays motorist that had even number license plates were told not to drive or face a $31 dollar fine. On the next day odd number license plate couldnt drive. 4,000 people were fined and 27 had their cars impounded do to their reaction to the fine. Their were a couple exceptions like plug-in cars, hybrids, also cars carrying more then three people but they make plubic transit free from Monday to Friday.

These acts are happening in countries like Colombia. In Bogota, Colombia they celebrate their third year where cars have been banned with the onmly motor transportation being buses and taxis. They call this day ""The day without cars"" in the capital city which has about 7million poeple. They are doing this to pormote other mean of transportation and violators adn fined $25. A lot of people like to participate in this because it lowers air pollution and stress. Because of this day this city has made 118 miles of bike paths.

In America scientist have found that people 16- to -39 years old are not etting their license. With this drop scientist think that pollution will go down in America. In 2005 the number of miles was at its peak and dropped steadily after that.Â In April of 2013 the number of miles driven per person was 9% below the peak and is even with the the amount in 1995 ",3,1,351

In the end online schooling isn't worth the all the struggles you'll have to face as an adult and in college and its my strong recommendation that you stay away from it. ,1,2,142

05B3CD46C701,"Conclusion.Â¨Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert driversÂ¨(9). Therefore, it is already hard enough to keep the drivers alert and watching the road while they are driving now, could you imagen how hard it would be to keep people alert when they have nothing to do? These laws are there to keep people safe and smart cars are the easy way to go not the safe way. Also, serious arguments would accure that would only cause problems not solve anything. Because what if this car gets into an accident while self-driving, would it be the drivers fault or the manufacture? Could you blame it on the driver and say they should have been more alert or say that the manufacture should have made/programed their cars better? These arguments and cases would be never ending, because almost all humans do not want to be saw as guilty so they would do and say anything to get off the hook. As to say, these smart driverless cars would do a lot more harm than help. ",3,2,188

05F5B97B159A,"Conclusion.When it first came to NASA and the public it was shown as if there was a human face becuase like it says in paragraph three, secound sentence, ""The caption noted a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving it the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" That to me tells me that there could have been life on Mars at some point in time but we were probably not exsiting back in the time life could have been in Mars. Its just a mesa becuase on paragraph seven, first and secound sentence, it says, ""So on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharpers than the original Viking photos.

Having a popular vote lets the citizens in big states that are metaphorically already ""chosen"" allows the minority vote to maybe have a chance in the office.

0825571D1A47,"Conclusion.Sadly students with learningÂ disabilities are forgotten about and neglected. Unlike children with autism or special needs students with attention disorders take the same classes as the general population. Therefore students 504 plans are followed based on who the teacher is, and sadly some teachers dont care. This means the student will not receive any accommodations such as more time on test. This can lead to poor grades, and not because the student isnt prepared. A student with ADD will have to read a problem 5 times before they really retain the information and even then everything is done slower because when students with attention disorders try to force their brain work too fast that is when things are forgotten and missed.

085CACF9DE2B,"Conclusion.In addition, driverless cars would be at an increased risk for technolgical malfunctions causing potentially fatal crashes. As of right now, the technology in driverless cars is only experimental and theoretical. It would take many years to iron out all the bugs, so to speak, to make these cars function properly all the time. As mentioned paragrpah nine of the article, in most of the Unites States, it is illegal to test drive driverless cars. It is illegal for these very reasons. It is illegal because experimenting with that kind of technology is dangerous.

085CACF9DE2B,"Conclusion.In addition, millions of dollars would be spent first to research and perfect the workings of the driverless cars. Not to mention, driverless cars would probably cost a larger sum of money than regular cars because of the time and cost of manufacturing them. In the past few years, in the United States has been going through a financial crisis. While our economy is now doing better, where would the money to fund these cars come from? In the article, the author mentions building smarter roads for cars. If that was the case, it would cost even more to fund this grand scheme. So much money is spent on paving and repairing roads every year, it would cost so much more to have to change or rebuild all of the roads in the country. In addition, if cars were to drive themselves, many laws would have to be changed for the new cars. Right now in the United States, one in five children will go hungry, there are clearly more important things to spend money on right now than to fund driverless cars. ",3,2,184

091315F8E9A9,"Conclusion.In this system, according to the second source, popular vote, which is what the majority people select, most of the time loses the election due to the Electoral System. An Example used in this source was the 2000 election with Al Gore, he had won the popular vote, but had lost the election thanks to the Electoral College. With this system in play, voters cannot control who they want to vote for and that is not how it should be. In source one, it clearly states most states have a ""winner-take-all"" type of system that awards all electors of that state to the specific candidate, which is the complete opposite of benefiting the people, because not everyone in that state wants to vote for that specific candidate. Source 3 says big states that a larger state gets more attention than a smaller state does because of the amount of votes, however some states claim they never even got to see a presidential campaign had because of how small the states was. Its is Unfair to these states which include Rhode Island, South Carolina. It takes away opportunities from these smaller states. ",3,2,192

093BD0824B7E,"Conclusion.Around middle and high school, classes aren't the only thing become harder, there is also pressure regarding students and their peers. Many teenage students may have a difficult time focusing in a classroom due to another students presence there which throws the student off. It could be whether it is a romantic interest, a bully, or someone who does not treat them well and makes them feel uncomfortable when they are in their presence. Or it could be that the student isn't comfortable around new people or doesn't like to be in a crowded place and prefer to be alone or in an environment in which they are used too. Regardless, it affects the student and negatively impacts their studies. If the student could attend a class through online means, or have a video conference with the teacher when they are teaching, they could still learn the material they need to know while at the same time staying in an environment where the student is comfortable in and not having to deal with peers who make the student feel uncomfortable.

0B30792F314D,Conclusion.In reality even though the popular vote doesn't make a difference it can persuade the representatives of the state to change their mind or it can make them realize that they are making the right decision because of how their state is chosing to vote.

0B52B1F1265B,"Conclusion.Many states agree with this and do not allow for driverless cars to occupy their roads. In paragraph 9 it explains how,""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars."" This quote tells you that the traffic laws of numerous states would need to be altered for driverless cars to be allowed. The majority of states believe that they are not safe and restrict their use. Traffic laws as well as liability laws would need to be redone in order to cover the safety. At the end of paragraph 9 it asks,""If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver of the manufacturer?"" This directly correlates to a lack of safety and major complications. In case of an accident, the victim would not know who to blame and in the end would severely suffer. There are way too much obstacles that obstruct the safety of too many citizens with driverless cars. ",3,2,186

12C119C37C62,"Conclusion.In the article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" Bradford Plumer states, ""And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occured is a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way."" Being that there is a lesser number of votes counted in an election due to the Electoral College, there is a highly greater chance of the outcome resulting in a tie rather than showing a clear winner. If the election was based off of the most popular vote, there would be a higher number of votes for each candidate, therefore reducing the chances of ending in a tie. Secondly, in the article, ""What is the Electoral College?"" the Office of the Federal Register wrote, ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral vote is required to elect the President."" This statement shows that the Electoral College requires more than just the majority of citizen's opinions. IfÂ  at least half of the population votes one way, there should be no question about who is the winner. The most popular vote system would award the candidate that was favored by at least half of the population, therefore providing a clear and fair election. Clearly, the most popular vote sysytem would significantly benefit the American Society. ",3,2,251

139B1A57D6A3,"Conclusion.On the top image of the article, it shows the images throughout the years of 1976 (left), 1998 (middle), and 2001 (right). The first image of 1976 which was taken by Viking 1 does look like a face at first, but you never know, they probably used a camera that wasn't really good, and the image was blurry. I think that is why the landform looks like a face. The second image of 1998 which was taken by Viking 2 is a little more clear, but also still looks like a face, but it is starting to fade away, the nose, mouth, and eyes.

The school would be responsible for not letting these kids participate in sports and other activities; therefore, in order to give them a better chance at getting the B average, the school should provide tutoring and extra help sessions for the kids who really need the help. The teachers could give them verbal quizzes on what they are learning if they are not very good test takers. They could give them homework that they might better understand and also provide them with extra credit opportunites.

over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we would want to have. this year voters can exspect another close election in which popular vote winner could again lose the presidency, but yet the electoral college has it defenders.

for example like obama had 61.7% of voters against romney who had 51.3% of votes but people say it was a tie which most likely i disagree on that. becuase its a like a win or lose game who ever wins gets the treatment, but really the president doesnt really dont do nothing.       Â    ",3,1,157

Students would have to test out the options first and see what works best. Because even though online school sounds good on paper, it could very well be horrid in practice. Students always want to find the easy way out, and online school could be that no challenge road. That would lead to a greater number of students failing out of rigorous courses, and a potential of uneducated students because of a lower retention of material.

As you may know the founding fathers established it, the Electoral College in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens (Office of the federal register, paragraph 1). Also, A majority of 270 out of 538 electoral voters is required to elect the president.

283F30E12B90,"Conclusion.During the 2012 election with Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, Romney had to win Ohio and Florida's Electoral vote. But becasue Obama won Florida he remained in office as our president. With this Electoral vote its a amke or break. Its not always the best thing but its the right thing. With the Electoral College you vote for a slate of voters who then vote for president. As Richard A. Posner informed us, "" Its entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular vote than Bush yet fewer electoral votes."" ",3,0,115

299C0AA4D716,"Conclusion.With popular vote though, candidates should be more inclined to visit as many states as possible and get their message out there. Because a 51% vote in a state no longer means a 100% victory. With the new influx of political campaigns, perhaps more people are swayed from their usual path of voting. While yes, there are neutral states that need a push either way, you're not going to increase your votes ten-fold by pushing past that 50% barrier. You actually have to earn every vote you get.

In the future, technology will advance even more than it already has, making online courses even more beneficial, possibly resorting to only online teaching.

One major disadvantage of working from home was the increased level of distrations, which led to an ultimate decrease in productivity amongst workers. If adults are not able to implement online working from home efficiently and effectively, how can students? Students need the rigid structure that a classroom provides. The classroom setting helps aid in developing proper work ethics that students can use in their future careers.

2C0A4D88629E,"Conclusion.So i believe that schools should keep people from having phones at school because some people came to learn and get smart and don't want the distraction of a phone keeping them from learning or doing a good job on tests, quizzes, and home work ",3,0,46

It could also effect those who through their trash out their car window. For example, they might say wow look what I'm making these kids do. I'm making them cleanup after me. This could get someone like that to stop throwing their trash out a window and start putting it in a trash can. It could also inspire them to help out or support the cleanup. ",3,2,99

Obama received only 51.3 percent of the popular vote and Obama got 61.7 percent of the Electoral College ",3,0,69
2C8521890B5A,"Conclusion.Also in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the Presiden"" (Paragraph 22)take Richard Nixon's and Bill Clinton's presidental campaign. Those two only won 43% of their popular votes but they won their elections with the Electoral College. Without the Electoral College all three of these presides wouldn't have become President of the United States. ",3,2,64
2C8521890B5A,"Conclusion.In ""The Inefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer key names such as Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, AFL-CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerece all want to get rid of the Electoral College and use the Popular Vote. Look at the presidency that was in 2000 with Al Gore against George W. Bush. Al Gore would have won the election if the election was based on the popular vote. He won the popular vote with over 60%! But unfortunately, he didn't win and lost to George W. Bush since Bush won the Electoral College votes. ",3,0,106
2C8521890B5A,"Conclusion.But some people don't really know what they are voting for in election which is why the Electoral College is the way to go. Also people complained with the ""winners take all method"" some candidates don't go to certain states and only focus on the swing states. In the 2000 campaign seventeen out of fifty states didn't see the candidates. But the candidates didn't go to those states since they knew they had no chance of winning those states and they needed to focus on the swing states to make sure they win the election. Many people do call the Electoral College an anachronism, but it doesn't need to stick in the past, it needs to be kept in the present and in the future. ",6,2,126
2C8EA34FDC34,"Concluding Statement.i still think that the electoral system is a way better way to help choose a president. There is step to choosing him. There are people that already know what to do with there job, its easy for them. So many times they did it that they are professional at doing it.

Now that their is a requirement of a B average to participate in sports, music, or another activity, the school would have much smarter students.

As a result, these students would be sent to better colleges.

If you have emails that need to be sent or a presentation that needs to be made, you can easily accomplish thoses tasks while ""driving"" the driverless car.

If at any point in time the car will give you a notification that you need to take over driving for a period of time, then all you have to do is stop your work for a short period of time to manually drive the car.

This shows that whatever the 23rd Amendment is under, that's what the District of Columbia is allocated. This is just like an case at court or when you getting arrested. For example, when you are pleged guilty for murder. The judge is going to read every amendment you broke and what's your charges. And everything that's she's reading is made up. It's all labeled in United State Constitution. This is why i strongly believe we should keep the Electroal College for the president of the United States.

And it's time for the President to see who or who he can't put his trust in. For example, A president has alot of things that we depend on him or her to do for our Country.

3030A5BB7889,Conclusion.They would become hooked to their phone and not listen to their teacher as much. But I would go ahead and have them use their phones through out the day when they are not in classes. Like say it started snowing really bad at school that day and your coach tells you at school that there will be no practice after school. You could call or text your parent ahead of time during school that there is no practice. So it would be more efficient for you and your parent both. Your parent could go home earlier without having to wait for you after practice. I just think that it is important to have your phone at least when your not in class. ,3,0,124

305B4157DD19,"Conclusion.You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors.

Your state's Certificates of Ascentainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. Abolishing the electoral college! According to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore,Richard Nixon,Jimmy Carter,Bob Dole,the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.

I don't think schools should judge kids on their grades by letting the grades decide if a student can participate in sports or not. according to this new rule, a student can have all A' s and one C, but it's not the A' s that matter then, it's that one little C. Don't let this new rule prevent any student from competing in sports. ",3,0,83
309BE8E1DCF1,"Conclusion.If you let a student's grade decide if a student can or can't compete in sports, you can be holding them back from healthy exercise and keep them from building confidence. Exercise keeps students healthy and when a student competes in sports, they are exercising. Every gym teacher I've ever had has always told us how daily exercise is important and I've seen many commercials that say growing kids and teens need at least one hour of exercise each day to keep physically fit and healthy. Sports also build confidence. When a team wins, it boosts a person's confidence. When you are confident, you feel that you can do anything and succeed. Sports provide healthy exercise and confidence to students, but if you keep this rule, you'll be depriving it from us. ",3,2,133

These shady electors, also known as ""faithless electors"", can deny to vote for their party's candidate and instead cast the vote for whomever they desire. This shows that it is not the people's choice, instead the choice of the elector. Also, the state legislatures are responsible for choosing the electors. This could cause an issue where the state legislatures are choosing electors who will vote for their party. Let's take it back to the 1960's where an example of this corruption almost took place. Segrigationists, or people who favored racial seperation, who were state legislatures in the state of Louisiana nearly suceeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would not vote for John F. Kennedy. This would've caused the popular vote to go to Kennedy's opponent. For the many reasons listed above, the Electoral College could be considered unpredictable and in some cases... shady.

346D40A69BBF,"Conclusion.The Electoral College is a process, consider a place. Our founding fathers established it in the our country`s Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by voting in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

The process of the Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors. They vote for th President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The Electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state`s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation, one for each member in the House of Representives plus two for your Senators. Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia(DC) is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. Every candidate running for President in your state has his or her own electors group.

The electors generally are chosen by the candidate`s political party, but the states laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, you help help choose your state`s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate`s electors. Than after the presidential election, your governor prepared a "" Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascetainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will resprent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president ",3,1,322
3493BED78E8E,Conclusion.The Electoral College System is wrong. ,0,1,7
3493BED78E8E,"Conclusion.The Electoral College system has a ""winner-take-all"" system. Which means if a Democrat candidate wins they will have Democrat electors and if a Republican wins the will have Republican electors. In source one the Office of the Federal Register also said that the ""winner-take-all"" system ""awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"". This is not fair to the voters or the United States. If a tie happened it would be even more unfair to voters. if a tie did happen the House of Representatives would break it. In source two Plumer said ""the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. If the voting doesnt even show your will why vote?

3697185C117D,"Conclusion.In order to understand the flaws in the electoral college, you need to know what the electoral college is, and how it came to be. ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" (Office of the Federal Register 2). This system was created by the founding fathers as a compromise between the congressional vote and the popular vote. However there was a reason for this new, seperated voting system. During their time the founding fathers where among the most educated men in the country. Back then education was not standard and very few people could read or write. The founding fathers did not want uneducated citizens voting on the individual who would lead the country. So they created a system where the uneducated would vote for a group of educated men, who would in turn vote on a president. Thus the electoral college was born. ",3,2,172
3697185C117D,"Conclusion.The number of electors per state under the Electoral College is determined by the number of representatives the state has in congress. ""... one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your senators..."" (Office of the Federal Register 3). Since this system is based on population, bigger states get a emense priority over smaller states. ""The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote , got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes."" (Posner 21). This means that presidential candidates are going to focus on appealing to larger swing states that have more electoral votes, rather than smaller ones who only provide a few votes. That is not fair now is it? No matter how small a state may be its population still consists of United States' citizens, and they deserve just as much say as a bigger state. After all, that is the concept our country was founded on, equality and freedom. ",3,2,178
3697185C117D,"Conclusion.If the Electoral College does not seem like a flawed system now, allow me to open your eyes to one last variable in our little Electoral equation. The disaster factor. The disaster factor deals with the will of the people, and them doing anything to get what they want. ",0,2,50
3697185C117D,"Conclusion.""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that the popular vote for Kennedy would not actually gone to Kennedy.)"" (Plumer 11). That kind of scenario could completely change a close call to a landslide victory! The 1960 election is not the only case of this either. It happened again when Hawaii sent two slates of electors to congress, and in other various cases electors did not vote for their designated candidate. Finally there is the case of the 2000 election, where Al Gore won the popular vote, but lost the Electoral College! If just one person decides to go against the grain, everything gets thrown off. ",3,2,126
37019C8C1ECD,Conclusion.Everyone has the right to vote but if their votes dont count whats the point? ,0,0,16
37019C8C1ECD,Conclusion.The electors that are chosen have only a little amount of opinions. If the voters would be included there would be a variety of choices of who should win. Every american should be comfortable and certain about who they voted for and if the Electoral College votes contradicts that there can be problems. ,3,1,54
37019C8C1ECD,"Conclusion.Moreover , Bigger states may have a bigger effect on the votes because of their large amount of people voting ",0,0,20
3712A5E56380,"Conclusion.The article, ""What Is the Electoral College?"" written by the Office of the Federal Register states, ""Most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"". That is not fair to other voters who don't vote for the popular candidate in their state; they don't receive any electors. Additionally, most candidates only advertise and visit ""swing"" states. ""Swing"" states are the states that usually determine the outcome of the election. ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" written by Bradford Plumer says, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad"". It's unjustifiable that simply because you have fewer electors in your state, you don't get to watch your candidates campaign. As previously mentioned, each state has a different number of electoral votes. It all depends on the population. For example, Texas, with a huge population has 38 electors, while Maine only has 4. The article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid out defenses of the system are wrong"" states, ""Beacuse each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"". Why do some states have more representatives than others just because of their population? It's not fair to the smaller states. It is true that the bigger states have more people in them, needing more representation, however, the smaller states have as much to say as the big ones. ' ",3,2,284
3712A5E56380,"Concluding Statement.To conclude, the Electoral College has caused many disastorous factors in our presidential campaigns. It has caused the wrong president to be elected, and it doesn't give our citizens much of a voice in the election. However, changing the system to popular vote for the president will give people a louder voice in this nation and it will show them that the government cares about their opinion. As the article, ""The Indefesible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid out defenses are wrong"" written by Bradford Plumer states, ""It's officual: The Electoral College is unfaor, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguents against direct elections are spurious at best. ",1,2,124
3716F4794AB4,"Conclusion.For example if the classes were not prerecorded or all written down and you had to listen to a teacher talk online, if you miss any information you wouldn't be able to communicate directly to the teacher for some time and wouldn't be able to ask questions until after the lesson. If the class was thought through notes online then students would't be able to communicate with the teacher directly and would have to email them which would take time for them to respond.

3716F4794AB4,Conclusion.Online classes wouldn't be able to supervise or restrict students from cheating on an assignment or a test depending on what website or program the students are using to take the class. Students can access any program when they use their own computers unless they are provided b'y the online school. Students could become lazy and skip the lessons because students would feel they have the option because they are in their own home. ,3,0,75
371834E7E1DD,"Conclusion.because candidates don't spent time in the states they know they will lose in. They only foucus on the states that they know they will win in or of a close chance to the other candidate, because of this there has been times when people would not see the candidates at all or they did'nt get to see a single campaign ad. If there was popular vote then this would not be the case and it would be eliminated, because candidates would have no choice but to put up advertisments all over the country. ",3,2,95
371834E7E1DD,Concluding Statement.The electoral college allowed some of are greatest presidents to win beacuse if they got more electoral votes then popular vote it would'nt matter they will still win. The electoral college also avoids the problem of one candidate not recieving the majority of the votes cast. The electoral college has been in are country for so long and has worked for us well but I still believe that the popular vote can be andÂ  should be used in future elections ,1,2,82

There are 538 electors that vote for president and vice president but there only has to be 270 votes required to elect the president or vice president. Congress has to count the votes in the same place that the electors voted in. Sometimes I don't agree with the president that they picked but I'm glad that honest people count the votes.

These large gatherings may make those affected very anxious or nervous, unable to focus, or susceptible to emotional or verbal outbursts. By moving the classroom to the home via distance learning, many of these problems brought on by large gatherings are eliminated because the student is now in the comfort of their own home, family, and possibly a couple other students, yet they are still obtaining the same education and life skills that a classroom would offer.

We should consider ourselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century, the system allows for much worst. Consider that state legislaturwes are responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.

Back in 1960, segregationist in Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors with new electors who would oppose for John F. Kennedy.

39FFFE0E3490,"Conclusion.Another example of how the Electoral College is unfair goes back to the 1960 campaign. Again stated by Bradford Plumer, ""The segregationists in the Louisiana legislature had nearly come to success in replacing Democratic electors with new electors that would oppose John F. Kennedy."" The state of Louisiana had attempted to do so because the popular vote for Kennedy, would not have actually gone to Kennedy; if they had succeeded in replacing those electors. There is also raise for concern in the event of a tie in a campaign. All 50 states would have only one vote and the selection of the House of Representatives would most likely not reflect the will of the American people. Also, the Senate chooses the vice-president.

There is pleanty of things wrong in this world, but one thing that is pretty good right now is the Electoral College. More times than not it has one winner and one loser, and rarely a tie. It makes sure that nobody is a favorite or feels like it. Also it shows things can change if something is a problem or needs fixing. The Electoral College is not perfect, but is not broken.

3A33CD269EA2,Conclusion.The Electoral College is a process not a place. When the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and also a popular vote of approved citizens. ,4,2,40
3A40B235E0C4,Conclusion.Prehaps most worrying is the prospect of the election vote would be tied in the elctorlal vote. In that case the election would thown to the house of represenitives where state delegation vote on the president ,3,1,37
3AD47B68A985,"Conclusion.Being a person of politics yourself, you of all people should know that many compromises have been made over the course of the establishment of the United States. However, some of the compromises, like the electoral college, were made because of factors in the past and are now not needed in today's modern democracy. While the electoral college once worked as a compromise in the past, it is an archaic system that unfairly represents the votes of citizens all across the nation. ",4,2,83
3AD47B68A985,"Conclusion.A popular vote should instead be utilized to fairly choose the people of power in this country and would better represent voters' opinions. 
",5,2,24
3AD47B68A985,"Conclusion.In implementing the electoral college, most states' votes either go to one candidate or the other, leading to candidates to only campaign in swing states (Bradford Plumer 13). ",0,2,29
3AD47B68A985,"Conclusion.In the Electoral College, ""voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"" (Bradford 10). These electors may not necessarily vote for what candidate voters want most as president, and could do what they might feel is the best decision; however, this is not always what the majority of voters want in a president and could end up with a poor president. In addition, most voters know very little about how these electors are chosen and are not in control of who their state's electors are. In a way this system is a bit corrupt, because the voters don't have the final say of the president. ",3,2,116
3AD47B68A985,Conclusion.Those in favor of the electoral college argue that because candidates will focus on swing states in order to win voters in those states will pay closer attention to the election and make a more educated decision (Richard A. Posner 20). ,2,2,42
3B3A47EA684D,Conclusion.I believe that changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average is a bad decision. ,5,0,31

However in the future when they become more advanced and safe they could potentialy prevent accidents. ",4,0,73
3B61207AD210,"Conclusion.Only a few states allow them so far, and what good is a car that is only legal in three states and the District of Columbia if you do not live there.

I think eventually the laws will change enough to allow them to function as long as they are safe and can pass certain tests. ",3,1,57
3B6B5DF452D6,"Conclusion.But they were only allowed to vote if they had certain papers to allopw saying they are citizens. The way that it works is that each person running has a group of electors and is counted by the congress to find out who is winning in the campain.

3B93FA6833FA,"Conclusion.Many don't focus upon their studies and teachers are time and time again to get them above their showing level of academics. Academics must have several students who try hard for their goal for whatever it is they want to do with their life. If somebody wants to be a millionaire, they have to work on being that throughout their life. Be a millionaire doesn't just come to you. You have to work your whole life for being this. If they want to be a hotdog man, a trash man, or even a McDonald's cashier, then they will have very little self-respect and very little low-self esteem. ",3,0,108
3B9A70FC3744,"Conclusion.When the US Constitution was first made, the idea of equality between the states was made. This meant that the size or population of a state gave it no disinct advantage over another. They did this through the creation of the House of Representatives and the Senate, yet there was one more issue they had to solve. This issue was how they could count the votes of citizens all aroun the US fairly. They solved it with electoral college, a system in which the voters don't directly vote for the president, but vote for a group, or slate, of people who have sworn to a canidate who vote for you. This system as Source 2 states can easily be broken with a group of swing votes in some states, but because it keeps thing equal, we must see that making popular vote the process isn't a good idea, because larger states will have more power.

3BD1B5A4F714,"Conclusion.For example, if a student wanted to learn how to play an instrument, they wouldn't be able to learn it because there would be no time for lessons. They would have to be doing community service which would take away the opportunity to learn. They also have many other responsibilities besides community service such as taking care of a younger sibling, focusing on school and education, house chores, and many others. Community service would be another responsibility that a child would have to take on and which maybe not even be prepared for. ",3,2,94
3C17ED55E3A8,"Conclusion.If most kids don't help by doing something where they live they usually don't appreciate what they have were they live. Community service is a great way of helping give back what your city or town gives to you everyday.

3C17ED55E3A8,"Conclusion.There are many tasks you could give out each week. For example you could give tasks like going around and cutting peoples yards, helping clean up all the litter in the place, or helping repaint an old building or place that has been needing one for a long time. 
",3,0,50
3C1F9041C565,"Conclusion.Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president they choose, but for a slate of electors, who in turn, elect the president. For instance, if you wanted to vote for a specific person you would vote for a slate of electors pledged to that person. ",3,0,49
3C1F9041C565,"Conclusion.The people in American should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the largest election crisis in a century; the system could have lead to much worse than that. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for choosing electors, adn that those electors could alwyas defy the will of the people ",3,0,53
3C4368A07D88,"Conclusion.Community service can help students with that by helping others and not feeling so alone. Like this one girl i knew was so caught up with her studies all she did then was go into her room and lock herself up. Later , when i noticed she'd gone too far i told her to help me clean up the streets that were covered in litter. She did and then from then on she found time for her work, friends, and community service ",3,2,82
3C5248E5C9F9,"Conclusion.I think choosing to change to election by popular vote would be more in my opinion because it'll be more fair and they vote for whoever they want and the one with the most popular vote wins, unlike the electoral college that seems unfair to me because when you vote it goes to the electors and the elector then goes and chooses who he wants to pick and he may pick a wrong candidate ",0,0,75
3C5248E5C9F9,Conclusion.But i believe if choosing to change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States it would be more fair to the people because they could see by the popular vote. Thats why i believe by changing to election by popular vote for the President of The United States it would be much better for people. ,3,1,61
3C5248E5C9F9,"Conclusion.Also Electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they have no chance in winning. ",0,0,28
3C5CFABBA1F0,"Conclusion.Every four years since the founding of the United States, a president has been elected by the people to lead the U.S. According to source 1, the system used to select the president is the Electoral College. The Electoral College involves voters voting for president they want, as normal, and then the president that got the majority vote in that state gets all of that state's electoral votes. ",4,0,70
3C5CFABBA1F0,Conclusion.but there is zero evidence shown to support this ,6,1,10
3C5CFABBA1F0,"Conclusion.The founding fathers could not have possibly thought that it would be possible to easily count all of the nation's votes with a machine, but now it is possible. It is likely that the reason they thought of the Electoral College in the first place was because it would mean that they could spread out the tallying of votes between the states, instead of doing it all at once. Nowadays though, there are computers that can count votes faster than ever imagined. Popular vote is now a viable method since every person's vote can be accurately counted. ",3,0,98
3C5CFABBA1F0,"Conclusion.To put this into perspective, here's an example of why supporting big swing states should not be rewarded. The US has 6 states. 5 are completely democrats and each have populations of 20. 1 is half democrat half republican and has a population of 100(assume 20 people equals an electoral vote). If the republican presidential candidate convinces a single democrat in the big state to vote for them, they will get the majority vote in that state and get 5 electoral votes. This results in the democratic presidential candidate, with 149 people supporting him, tying with the republican presidential candidate, with 51 people supporting him. Simple logic shows that the opinion of 149 people is more important than that of 51 people, so a popular vote system would have been best in this situation. ",3,2,135

3C80E1F48330,"Conclusion.On our planet earth, we have land structures called ""Mesas."" These elevated lands are found in the ""American West"", where the surrounding deserts (used to be oceans in theory), are now filled with canyons, rock flats, salt flats, mesas, and other forms only found there. Mars might as well have a northwest region where one could find earthlike simularities ",3,0,61

3CA61DE9B5C6,"Conclusion.Cell phones today are generally used for many reasons. They may be used for texting, calling, emergencies, and many more reasons. Shocking but true, in this day in time, people need cell phones. Some may be against this matter, but do they know everything besides teens texting everywhere they go? Cell phones are one of the major ways of communicating. ",4,2,61
3CA61DE9B5C6,"Conclusion.Calling your parent for a quick minute or two may secure your way of getting home or even to obtain a book you might have left at home for your next class. Also, talking to other classmates throughout your school may give you extra time to study with them or to finish a couple of assignments you were unsure about or needed help on. Communicating with cell phones will provide you extra time to do this by sending a text or giving them a quick call, after all lunch time and free periods don't last forever. This takes less time and gives you extra time for many other priorities you may have. ",3,2,113
3CA61DE9B5C6,"Concluding Statement.All in all, changing the cell phone policy will benefit the school in various ways. There needs to be a sense of trust and knowing they have responsibility inside them first. Students aren't always going to do the right thing. However, giving them this time will allow them to escape and talk with friends that they may not see everyday. This new policy will provide everyone with many opportunities that will have a positive effect. ",1,2,77
3CBB0AD46687,Conclusion.When you vote for the President you should be directly voting for him or her not voting for an electoral slate. Candidates should try to win the vote of everyone no matter what not heavily campaign in some states and rarely campaign in others. ,3,0,45

3D7740BCAA23,"Conclusion.The Electoral College consists of 538 electors.Â  With majority of 270 votes are needed so there is a good chance of getting a fair shot to win.Â  Each candidate running for president in a state has to have there own group of electors which eguals out the odds.Â  The electors are chosen by the candidates political party.Â  In most states they have a winner takes all system but Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportion.

The certificate of ascertainment also declares the winning presidental candidate in the state and shows which electors will be representing your state at the metting of the electors which helps us to know who had won the presidental election.Â  Voting for a state election of who will turn elected for president. When voting you would have to vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors to pledge for Kerry.

Voting for a president is like voting for a state elector.Â  Even though a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible it has only happened in 2000 but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote.Â  The reason is that the winning candidate shares the Electoral College invariably exceeds his shares of the popular vote.Â  The Electoral college requires an apresidental candidate to have transregional appeal.

The residents of the other religions are likely to feel disenfranchised and that their votes does not count and that the new president will have know regard for their interests.Â  That he is not really there president.Â  The winner of all methods of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates like as seen in the election of 2012.Â  They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters on average and that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidate as the most thoughful voter should be the one to decide the election.

The Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constituion.Â  Having the electoral College avoids the problem of electiong in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.Â  It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potental voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state, Democrats in Texas for example or Republicans in California.

Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee and is rarely betrayed, however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote than Bush yet fewer electoral votes.Â  As some would say the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.Â  The best arguments in favor of it are most likely assertions without much basis in reality.Â     ",3,1,469

3D99FC2386BD,Conclusion.that people can still steer and accelerte and slow down with just sensors and you can use half of the fuel and aloowing better response aand reduce power from the engine and the sensors make the car safer to drive . but it may not be safe to drive computer driven cars because of malfinction and that can be dangerous and they have to wait to make sure that is is reliably safe to drive it may not be as easy as they make it seem. sometimes the driver has to take over to pull in and out out of driveways to be on the safe side but the driverless car runs on electrical cables wich may not be safe that runs through radio signals to the front of the car. This may be alot of work to just drive a car beacsue of smarter roads and they need a whole lot of sensors on the car but they are still waiting on the law. ,3,1,165

42D8CCA3643E,"Conclusion.School is one part of student's lives and some only have a limited amount of time they can put towards that one part. Many people struggle with family matters and are not always left out of them because they attend school. A student might be going to school everyday and as soon as they get home, they are taking care of another member in their family or cooking and cleaning. Many kids run their households because their parents are not in the right condition to act their part. This leads to students working and schooling. All those things take up a big portion of time and can cause much stress on the individual. Also, many times, students just fall ill out of nowhere, and are in such conditions where they have to stay home and rest. Having access to classes online and availableÂ to them at any given time reduces much burdens off their shoulders. No one really knows what goes on in student's lives outside of school, so the opportunity to attend classes should be permitted. ",3,2,178

451D81265E8E,"Conclusion.According to source one, ""What Is The Electoral College?"", each political party has it's own set of electors that equal the amount of congressional delegates per state. Usually each state has a ""winner-take-all"" method, so the presidential candidate that gets majority in your state will get all of the electors that represent their party, not just most of them. This is beneficicial to the outcome of the election becuase it makes the ability for a candiate to get majority vote much simpler. There is less of a possibility of a tie, or an outcome where no candidate wins. Source 3, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing president"", states that ""even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state..."" , therefore allowing the candidate to secure all votes to their side, instead of having the votes divided on the line of majority rule, and causing rifts between Electoral College voters.

Even if there is still a driver in the seat, as said in paragraph 8, what will keep their attention on the road and not fixated on their phone or other passengers?

No amount of buzzing or flashing lights will get the attention of the driver to whatever accident may occur quick enough to make a change.

If anything, the displays will make the driver panic in such a way that will make their safety decline further. ",3,2,127

4A19AA269331,Conclusion.i think that we should cape the electoral college process ,5,0,11
4A19AA269331,"Conclusion.The electoral college has 538 electors but the president needs to have 270 electoral votes to become the president. The 23 amendment of the contitution allows columbia 3 electors and treated like a state for purpose of the electoral college. When you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates electors. Every candidate running for president in your state has his or her own goup of electors. Some states have a winner take all system, which gives all the electors a award to the winning presidential candidate.

After the presidential election the governor prepares a ""certificate of ascertainment"" listing the candidates who ran for president. The certificate of ascertainment declares the winning presidential candidate in my state will represent your state at the meeting of electors ",3,1,130
4A19AA269331,Conclusion.There is pressure for running off election when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast that pressure which would complicate the presidential election process is reduced by the electoral college which produces a clear winner. ,3,0,38
4A5D0595AB31,Conclusion.Do you think that the FACE was created by aliens ? Well i think the face is just a land form but thats how i feel about it ,5,1,28
4A5D0595AB31,"Conclusion.So they photographed the face as soon as they could get a good shot at it . On April 8, 2001 a cloudless summer day in cydonia Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look . When they had did they a pixel in the 2001 image spams 1.56 meters , they image was not a face anymore it was really Martain equivalent of a butte or masa . It reminds me of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. "" 
",3,0,87
4A5D0595AB31,"Concluding Statement.Finally, now you see that there were no aliens on mars and they aliens are not real . It was just the Martian equivalent of butte or mesa landforms . so now with all this information i just gave you, you should believe me now .      ",1,0,45
4A8B8527DD14,Conclusion.You may think that the face on mars was created by aliens and we say it isn't it's a natural landform sorta like some natural landforms on Earth like the Grand Canyon it's a natural landform ,5,0,37
4A8B8527DD14,Conclusion.we can't actually prve the the face is a landform but we have a spacecraft named Viking 1 and 2 that has taken pictures of it so we can see if it was formed by aliens or if it is just a natural landform. ,0,0,45
4A8B8527DD14,"Conclusion.So as it says in the article ""It's not easy to target Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips we just don't pass over the face ver often."" 
",3,1,50

4A8FCC8C7D9B,"Conclusion.To Start off with is why did i pick this, i pick this because the electoral college is a moving process full of educated students looking to make whats best out of what ever they have. ''the founding fathers established it in the constitution'' that students over 18 can vote ",0,1,51
4ABA61F516D1,"Conclusion.""faithless"" electors may refuse to vote for their party's candidate and could cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. ",0,2,21
4ABA61F516D1,"Conclusion.In the 1960 election, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy and make it seem that a popular vote would have not gone to Kennedy. What would happen if their was a tie in the electoral vote? The case would be thrown in the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Becasue each state counts for only one vote, a single representative from Wyoming would represent 500,000 voters, 55 representatives from California who getto represent 55 representatives would have as much say as the one from Wyoming.

4B6343C4BF5B,Conclusion.I feel that are state would benefit in a positive way with the way that popular vote is set up. looking at theÂ  past history the electoral college is not benefiting us in a positive direction. ,0,0,37
4B6343C4BF5B,Conclusion.because what happens if i vote for a elector and he doesnt go for my person to win. That just makes me feel dumb then if the elector does vote for the same person asme its not really even final becuase that vote doesnt go towards the president it goes toward the state elector and its basically there choice. ,3,0,60
4B6343C4BF5B,Conclusion.with that being said with the presidents trying to run for president the will actually try to reach the peoples needs to meet there satisfactory. the swing states is sayiong that there one state isnt going to decide the whole election.Â  Â  Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â     ,6,1,42
4B6A52E23DE9,"Conclusion.Because, when people vote they are technically voting for the electors for a candited. That candidate can be a democratic or a republican. ",0,2,24
4B6A52E23DE9,"Conclusion.for example if one state candidate was choosen for republican and they were ""faithless"" as it says in source two, and chose the democratic party it would be very unfortunate for the republicans because than there would be no point of the votes the republican supporters have voted for. It only comes once every four years, this is very important to the american people, on choosing who they want for the future of america. ",3,2,75
4B6A52E23DE9,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion,Â  the state senators should eliminate the electoral collge because they count the majorty votes, and don't count other votes that is not popular as the other candidates vote. also because they can decide vote on an canditate they want based on their opinions and beliefs. and lastly because of the winner takes it all system which is bascially taking the losing candidates electoral votes.

4BA61396D272,"Conclusion.Under the system of electoral college voters vote not for presdint ,but for a slate of electors instead. It could help us undersatnd voting for our electors if you keep electoral voting. Even though some say that this was the 2000 fisaco was the biggest election crisis in a century. The system could of had worse. I think it helps with voting more than anything else instead of the online voting for the slate electors. ",3,0,76
4BB2F265CFEB,"Conclusion.This is because some people vote for a president that they are not voting for. People wish that the person that they are voting should be president. Yes we should follow the constitutuion but something we should not follow at all. On paragragh 10 it says that when you vote you don't vote for the president you vote for the slate of electors. Then they pick who should be the president. People have the chance to vote for who should be the president. For,example, when something happen in 2000 gore and bush. Gore had the upper hand and was going to will but then instead of gore winning bush on. ",3,0,112

4BD93FED6367,"Conclusion.A Face on Mars, or just a common mesa? Many skeptics belive that the mesa on Mars, located at 41 degrees north martian latitude, is proof of ancient alien civilazation. In 1976, when NASA's Viking 1 crossed over a landform that showed ""shadowy likeness"" of a human face. When NASA revealed the picture to the public, thinking it would be a good way to draw attention to Mars, caused an uproar. ",4,1,72
4BD93FED6367,"Conclusion.A few years later, Micheal Malin and his team took a picture 10x sharper than that of the Viking 1 spacecraft. When the photo first appeared online, it showed nothing but a common mesa that can be found in the American west. ",3,0,43

4CA37D113612,Conclusion.I personally think that we should keep it. The Electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. ,3,1,42
4CA37D113612,Conclusion.It's the electors that elect the president not the people. When your voting for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee ,3,1,40

5137514F130A,Conclusion.The one with the most popular vote should win. When you vote for a presidential candidate you are actually voting for slate of electors. The electoral college consist of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. If you where running for president and you didnt have as many votes from the people as the ofter guy you can still win the election cause of the electoral college is the one that makes the decision to who we have as the president. ,3,0,90

515CEA13AEE5,Conclusion.if you wanted to vote for the presidant then vote i dont get why you have to go through a big system just to vote i think its just easier just to vote a regular way and it takes so long and it also depeneds on what state you are in and how you have to vote in texas if you wanted to vote for a certain person you would have to vote for the slate of 34 or what the number of that person is like for example if you voted for Jhon Kerry you would have to vote for slate of 34 democratic electors it just depends on the state ,3,0,113
515CEA13AEE5,Concluding Statement.this is why i think we should not have the electoral college becuase it causes to much cauase throught all the steps you have to go through it takes so much time up and there is so many other thing we can be focusing on i think the electral college needs to be gone and over with and we need to find other ways to vote for the presidant and the vice presidant ,1,0,75

563F7AD6C619,"Conclusion.The Electoral college is all high and mighty and is a process that consists of the selection of the electors. During the meeting of the electors, they discuss the presidents and vice presidents that are trying out for there 'role' in society. They also align the counting of the electoral votes by the Congress men. If you did not know Senator the Electoral College or as we call it ""EC"" consists of 538 electors in the so called 'pole'. A majority of those electors are 270 votes that are required to elect the President.

5694D233EAF6,"Conclusion.The balance between smaller and larger states comes into play here as well. Take Florida for example, a state with 29 total electoral votes. If the mass majority of Florida votes for a certain set of electors, the minority votes for the other ones would not matter at all, as the electors speaking for that certain fraction of the population would not elected. With popular voting, each and every vote would matter towards electing a president. The number of minority votes would directly apply to the outcome of the president. ",3,2,91

If we don't know who we are voting for then why vote. ",3,1,70
569CBA2B3B8F,"Conclusion.the bigger the state the more electoral votes it gets is not for every state should count as a equal amount of votes because its like the little states doesn't get any say in who gets to represent us.

56CE93447F80,Conclusion.Dear senator I am arguing to you in favor of keeping the Electoral College for the voting process of the president. ,5,0,22
56EE0E1D79CB,Conclusion.So you really cant trust if you are going to end up with the right president. Who is picking the electors anyway? Random people are going to vote for our president. Why should we trust them? ,3,1,37
56EE0E1D79CB,"Conclusion.because just the the election back in 2012 ""Obama's electorial vote was 61.7 and then the popular vote concluded with a 51.3, that doesnt seem fair no does it? ",3,1,32
56EE0E1D79CB,"Concluding Statement.So the only realalistic way of the new voting system is by popular vote because its fair, there is less harm, and because we know who's voting for our president. Like i previously stated ""Popular vote does not only allow the people to have the president they want but does not cause more viloence and disruption.""    ",1,0,59

575107B10B0B,"Conclusion.The one word used throughout this whole article ; catastrophic, which is whats best used to describe the electoral college. The United States of America, born and based off of popular soverignty, should be justÂ  that ; decided by the people. The electoral college has only been a hindrance since its arrival, confusing American Citizens left and right, becoming an issue to voters/interested future voters, and disallowing a fair chance of a voters vote to be of importance in their state, and to their country.

575107B10B0B,Conclusion.The electoral college should be disbanded and reiterized by popular vote ,5,0,12

575107B10B0B,Conclusion.Some have also stated that this is necessary to providing a more organized form of voting ,2,2,17
575107B10B0B,"Concluding Statement.To summarize, and simplify (what should be done with our voting ways) this letter to you, we should remove the electoral college overall and implement the popular voting, to which our country is based off of. This is the most profound way of fixing the problems that we face: the unsimplicity known as our current voting ways, and the restablishment of our original, and hopefully still true government of Democracy, and Popular Soveriegnty.    ",1,2,75
5773EED58DF2,"Conclusion.The electoral college process consists of selecting electors, as you know, but those electors do not always vote for their partie's candidates like they should. This process causes the popular vote to not always guarantee pesidency to a certain candidate even if they have the popular vote. In 2000 Al Gore had won the popular vote but lost presidency because of the electoral college. Not only did one inncident occur but multiple occur because of the electoral college. As stated in paragraph 11 of Bradford Plumer's article, in 1960 segregationists in Louisiana's legislature almost succeeded in replacing Democratic electors with new electors who opposed John F. Kennedy so if Kennedy got the popular vote he wouldnt have got the presidency. Like Bradford Plumer clearly stated ""the electoral college is unfair outdated and irrational."" The electoral college should be abolished so that problems can be eliminated and elections are fair. ",3,2,151

57B41EC7CB9A,Conclusion.Some people don't really agree with the electoral college process because they belive that if you vote you are voting for electors of your state that eventually vote for you at the end ,2,1,34
57B41EC7CB9A,"Conclusion.For example, if you lived in Texas and you wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. And everyone's question might be ""who are those electors?' The electors can be anyone not holding public office. That's why there's a 60% vote against the electoral college ",3,0,57
57B68E9AEF5E,"Conclusion.To start off, the electoral college is a system thats been around for ever but is getting outdated. I think that some people might want a different system while others prefer the same or dont care. For all we know,Bob Dole could be right about abolishing the electoral college. Or maybe it needs a new way of carrying the votes. ",4,2,62
57B68E9AEF5E,Conclusion.I think we should get a new system as well ,5,0,11
57B68E9AEF5E,"Conclusion.If we were to vote for just the president and vice president of the state and whomever else we vote for, less problems would be seen. ",0,0,27
57B68E9AEF5E,"Conclusion.More factors are that the state legislatures are basically responsible for choosing the electors. This is a very unfair factor because they choose people who oppose a candidate. If that happens, the popular votes dont transfer to that specific candidate. Also sometimes the electors refuse to vote. ",3,0,48
584D358FE757,"Conclusion.There is a quote that states, ""Be careful what you wish for becuase you just might get it."" What this quote boils down to is that as much as one might want something that aesthetically pleases them, it may turn around to be a truly awful mistake. Driverless cars cause more trouble then they are worth. ",0,2,58

The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worst."" This shows that the electoral college does do damage to the United States because they let a huge crisis happen during the elections. They could have let it get even worst because they allow it to and make it easy to make things worst in certain crisis. ",3,0,107
5991DAD0977F,"Conclusion.Voters pay to vote, to what pay the Electoral College to vote and make their say so important it is sad. The reason it is sad is because all kids want to do when their younger is vote because they feel like it symbolizes them growing up and like they get a real say in who the next president is or the senate anything just as longs as they get a say.

5A510998E08B,Conclusion.Have you ever wondered why the citizens of a country have the opportunity to voice their opinion in which who they feel should be president. Well i found some information in source 1 that talks about electoral college. Electoral college is not a place but its a process that was found in the constitution as a compromise between election of president by the votes in congress and election oof the president by a popular votes of qualified citizens of the country. ,4,0,82
5A510998E08B,Conclusion.But the bad side about the electoral college is that what happens if thr president you like is a republican but you like the democratic senator? Well i dont know what your going to do then because going to be a problem. ,2,1,43
5A91E373F462,"Conclusion.know that community service is a good thing to do but we also need to look out for ourselves. We have schoolwork that needs to be completed, extracurricular activities to do, and chores back home that need to be completed, we just wouldn't have enough time! ",5,2,47
5AD3EAC6A195,"Conclusion.When there is snow in the forecast, students and teachers alike eagerly await a call from Generic_Name, the beloved public information officer for Generic_City Public Schools. Cheers are heard across the county when his voice is heard on the phone announcing that school will be closed due to the weather. Both students and teachers embrace the well-needed break, using the time off to catch up on grading, get some much needed sleep, relax, pursue hobbies, or hang out with friends. Continuing the learning process on these days off would lead to stress for unprepared teachers and sleep-deprived students. However, when snow days and other such holidays start to build up, classes may fall behind in the curriculum. This would lead to teachers rushing to cover all the material before the AP test or state-mandated final exam, and students struggling to understand the new material so quickly ",4,2,147
5AD3EAC6A195,"Conclusion.because it does not offer the same environment for learning as a traditional classroom, ",0,2,15
5AD3EAC6A195,"Conclusion.A teacher who knows their students can better tailor the lessons to them based on their learning styles and needs. For example, a teacher could dedicate more time in class to review logarithmic functions with games or act out

Romeo and Juliet to help the students better understand the concepts. Activities such as these that are beneficial to students are not possible through distance learning, and could harm a student's level of understanding about a topic. Additionally, it is harder for students to get help when they do not understand new material or need clarification through distance learning. Traditionally, students can ask their teachers questions, visit their teachers during their office hours or study hall, or meet with a peer tutor. For distance learning, a student would have to video call or email their teacher, but it is much harder to explain or understand concepts without being able to meet in person. ",3,2,153
5AD3EAC6A195,"Conclusion.If both are possible options, a traditional classroom offers better education and support for the students; however, in cases where it is not possible to access a school for an extended period of time due to dangerous road conditions or the threat of a novel virus, for example, distance learning is a good alternative to stay on track and finish teaching everything in the curriculum and therefore be prepared for exams. ",2,2,72
5AD3EAC6A195,"Conclusion.When students see their teachers everyday or every other day, not only do they learn about the subject matter, but also about each other as people. When students have a good relationship with a teacher, they seek advice from their teachers, ask for teacher recommendations, and talk about their successes and shortcomings both within the subject area and outside of school. The impact of this type of relationship can often be felt long after graduation. In addition, it is also much easier for a student to discuss with or ask questions to someone they feel comfortable around. A teacher that is unknown or only seen through a video conference feels foreign and awkward, making communication and understanding difficult. Then there are relationships between students: close friend groups, couples, study groups, and lab partners, all important parts of high school. Students build relationships that foster discussion and learning, as well as support each other emotionally. Musical ensembles, honor societies, volunteer organizations, sports teams, and student government, among other extracurriculars, would not be possible without physically meeting. Activities like these build close connections by bringing together people who share similar interests and impart specific knowledge outside of the core classes. Overall, collaboration between students teaches vital communication, teamwork, and leadership skills that are necessary regardless of profession and can only be gained through shared experience. ",3,2,224
5AD3EAC6A195,"Conclusion.In schools, there are counselors, coaches, teachers, and friends who can identify if a student is not doing well and get them the help they need. Without interacting in person, it is hard to tell if a student is struggling and in need of help. This type of attention could be the difference between life or death in extreme cases, and should not be overlooked. In fact, more and more schools are placing a greater emphasis on mental illness and stress. Schools often encourage students to engage in de-stressing activities such as yoga, meditation, or sports. Because the focus of distance learning is purely learning, there is no emphasis on the well-beingÂ of students, a practice that could lead to detri mental consequences for students in the long-run.

Once they understood the circumstances, parents and students started to have questions; ""how will the students continue getting their education?"", ""what format will it be in?"", and ""how will it be administered?"" The response that most school counties developed for these questions was long distance learning. Distance learning is a new format of teaching where students stay at their homes while completing assignments; but, this method of learning has gotten somewhat controversial. Many teachers argue that distance learning is not effective and that it allows for students to copy, cheat, or flat out be lazy. This is a true judgment, but misled; ",4,2,167

5B43D8B934CC,"Conclusion.Started with the founding fathers. The Electoral College was founded and swung into the constitution, as a compromise between Congress and the President with a popular and electoral vote. Now that time has evolved and the world has changed. The Electoral College is not in the favor of everyones expectations, it seems like it favors one side more than it favors others. ",4,2,63
5B43D8B934CC,"Conclusion.Electoral College has been around for centuries, but now people feel as if the way presidents are being chose to run our country is unfair. The Electoral College is an unfair way of choosing presidents, by it being known as a winner-take-all system. Stated in the passage, ""Candidates don't spend time in the states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states."" The candidates in the ""lame"" states did not even see a single campaign ad. The swing states have a higher chance and more likely to see their campaign ads, because they are the more popular states. The more popular states are ""the most thoughtful votes, and should be the ones to decided the election."" Swing states get campaign ads, they are the ones who are being favored, while there are other states just trying to get a campaign sign, and get their votes recognized. ",3,2,159
5B43D8B934CC,"Conclusion.Stated in the passage ""Election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where delegations vote on the president."" Us people, us as citizens would not even be in charge or have a say so in who runs our country. We would not even have a choice or chance to vote and see who is worthy and most honorable in our eyes to be our president. Some may be lucky on the Representative choices on who the Electors and our Presidents would be, but also some may be dissatisified. The favor will only be in the representaives place. And the odds will be onto us. The Electoral College is not ran by the Representatives. We have a say so. ",3,1,121
5B43D8B934CC,"Concluding Statement.Finally, the Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote, because it is an unfair way of choosing the president, it is also known as a non-democratic method of having one side favored, and it can cause catastrophe.

5C9627F63CB8,"Conclusion.Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Their cars had driven more than half a miliion miles without a crash.

In 2013, BMW announced the devolopment of ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" the car can handle driving functions at speeds up tp 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills ,such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situations requires. This necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the drivers attention whenever a problem occurs.

GM has devoloped driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. Other options under considerartions are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays. Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver.

Tesla has a projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. In 2020 the cars that would be able to drive by themself are Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan. ",3,1,238

5FFA4762D642,"Conclusion.like the one in the 2000 Al Gore VS. Bush Presidential election. Imagine if that were to happen again, only, this time, we put a blood thirsty, war hungry, nuclear savage into office. Imagine the Iraq and Afghanistan wars from 2000-present and then imagine them being fought on our own soil, imagine, instead of little Iragi children fighting against an invading force, your children fighting against an invading force, and that is just one of the minor things that could happen. Imagine if we put a man in office who thought the way to answer everything was through nuclear war, imagine what would happen to the United States. These are just a few examples of what could happen if another ""disaster factor"" were to happen again. ",3,2,127
603108B7285B,"Conclusion.There is a lot contraversy regarding the Electoral College system of voting in the United States. Some voting members would argue that the system, although flawed, has yet to make a monumental mistake, and say that the minor issues were resolved or at the very least barely effective in the overall outcome of the capmaign. However, with the flaws and holes in the system we have alerady experienced, there is bound to be many more mistakes, and it would be shocking to very few that some of those mistakes are catastrophic ",4,2,92
603108B7285B,"Conclusion.The Elecoral College uses a group of people from each state, numbers varying from each, to represent voters in an election. The voters mark down a candidate on a ballot. However, they are actually voting for a group of strangers to represent them. Many voters do not even realize that this is the case. In politics, there are many powerful and influential people who will go to drastic measures to ensure that their ideas somehow make it to power. Bribes and insentives could easily be given to electors in attempts to sway their vote. Speaking of, these electors can be anyone who are not in a public office position, emphasis on the anyone. Voters can never really be sure that they can trust those strangers who they did not even get to select. Once the votes have been counted, voters cannot fully control who the elctors actually vote for. There have been instances where electors have attempted to completely avert the votes cast and choose a different candidate that they want in office. ",3,2,174
603108B7285B,"Conclusion.In 1960, a group of segretationists in the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in removing electors who supported John F. Kennedy with those who opposed him. If this had happened, all of the states electoral votes would have been cast by biased electors, rather than by the actual voters themselves. In the same year, Hawaii sent two state electors to congress instead of one. It is sad that we maintain a system in our government that continues to let issues like this arise. Along with issues with the electors, why is it that the size of a state automatically gives it a bigger advantage in elections? Texas and California are the most two saught-after swing states in every election. Candidates will do everything they can to win over those electoral votes. But what about the little states? Many of the smaller states do not get visited by candidates. Some never even see campaign ads. This system we are using creates target areas in the United States that are more valuable in elections than others. This is in no way fair to the voters in smaller states, despite having the exact same rights as voters of bigger states. ",3,2,197
603108B7285B,"Conclusion.For as many frustratingly resolvable problems that are created by the Electoral College, there are certain things about the Electoral College that could possibly make it worth keeping. ",2,2,29
603D38C864DD,"Conclusion.There is different things we can do though. Instead of ""making"" people do community service. We could have a chart over a year and the child has to do so many hours of service can get credits for graduation. ",6,0,40
603D38C864DD,"Conclusion.But not so much that they could fail all classes and still be able to graduate because they did so much community service.

If you are really going to take this seriously I would highly suggest asking the children if they would like to do this. If a lot of people are interested maybe make a sign-up sheet for them. Since so many kids are busy you shouldn't make them doing something likes this unless they are volunteering there spared time. ",3,0,82

I feel like the other method is just to complex so we should stick to the college voting method. almost half of the time to president we choose is the right president for the US. ,3,0,60
6058577A0EB1,Conclusion.Another reason we should keep the college method is because it wouldnt take that long. ,0,1,16

605DDEFB7A40,"Conclusion.When you go to vote, you don't actually vote for the candidate, you vote for a group of people who in turn vote for the candidate. I find this to be ineffective, because the people you are voting for are still able to switch there vote to the other party, ",0,2,51
605DDEFB7A40,"Conclusion.But big states, like California, Texas, and Florida have some of the most points, so if you were to win those, you already have more than one hundred points. Candidates would try to just seek out those jumbo prizes and systematicaly try to win the largest behind ""the Big Four"". If someone was reading this and wanted the Electoral College, they could say that the big states would still have an advantage with more voters, and that is right, but they wouldn't be as big of prizes. So the election turns from a voice of the people, speaking up for a new leader, and turns into a mad chase to get the biggest prizes before the other party, like a game of Monopoly. In Monopoly, you buy areas with your money, and when someone lands on that space you own, they have to pay you. The places ath the end of the board have the priciest cost, but the best outcome. You can also build property on spaces to make the enemy players pay more. If you were to buy those, you practically win the game. On the other hand, the spaces at the begining are basiclly worthless, costing about 100 dollars and giving you about 1000. Those are like the small states, that have almost no value to the election, and the big states are worth a lot. ",3,2,230

60C439A28A94,"Conclusion.One of the many reasons why schools exist is to provide a social setting that students are able to immerse themselves in. Schools provide a setting in which students are able to able to socialize with other students, creating a group or community for themselves as they form friends with the students they attend these classes with. ",0,2,58
60C439A28A94,"Conclusion.Not only do schools and classroom settings provide the ability for one to form relationships and learn how to interact with other students and adults, they also instill the necessary cooperative skills that students need in the real world once they have completed their school career and move onto the next step of their adulthood. ",0,2,56
60C439A28A94,"Concluding Statement.When comparing distance learning and in-class learning, it is evident that students would benefit much more from being in a classroom setting than from learning in the comfort of their own homes. Not only do online classes and video conferences lack the ability for students to gain any sort of social skills, but they also lack the ability to teach students how to cooperate with one another, which is an important skill that students must acquire to survive the real world. In addition, in-class learning allows for students to ask for help when needed. It is because of this that students would not benefit from attending classes at home. ",1,2,111

It lets them know what people want from the government, allows them to have the freedom to make a choice of the president, and gives the government a picture of how many people liked a candidate's plan for them.

In the car that he is overseeing, it uses heads-up displays and information systems that will notify you of an accident ahead or a roadblock that calls for a detour. The displays can be automatically turned off which is something not available to drivers who are texting and driving. Another detail would be that of manufacturers consideration of using cameras to watch the driver to make sure that the driver is paying attention if he or she needs to take control of the car. If the driver is paying attention to the road, then he will not need to be notified and or have the company of that car be notified. It allows the driver to pay closer attention to the road and not his surroundings. ",3,2,148

656C7C849144,"Conclusion.The Electoral COllege votes work so that the population of a state directly effects the amount of votes that states recieves. For example, Wyoming only has about 500,000 voters so it only recieves one electoral college vote.

6699DEA066F3,Conclusion.Even though online classes can make students feel comfortable with working on their own time ,2,0,16
6699DEA066F3,"Conclusion.There are students have jobs, have lots of homework, and have emergencies, so online classrooms can benefit these students because online learning can allow the student to work on their own pace. For example, if a student has a death in the family, the student should take time off from school to mourn and attend services. If that student missed classroom taught classes, the learning experience the student missed cannot be brought back since the entire class as whole moves on through a designated schedule, and the student would have much work to catch up on in little time. But, if the student was taking online classes and missed multiple classes, the student would only worry little in comparison to a classroom student. Since online classes allow students to work on their own time, the student with the family emergency can always catch up whenever he is done with his personal business and he does not have to worry about other classmates' progress in the class. That way, online learning can be beneficial to the student. ",3,2,177
6699DEA066F3,"Conclusion.Online, the student is limited to a screen with lesson materials on it. Also, schools and teachers are limited to adding documents, websites, and tests online. Because of these limits, the online experience feels dull and straightforward with tests and documents. In a physical classroom, there are lectures, models, posters, and hands-on activities available to the student. These physical resources can help a student remember class materials better through the unique experience they would go through. Unlike the online learning experience, a physical learning experience is flexible and fun to the student. A computer will fail to produce these resources to the students because of its limited functionality from technology. ",3,2,111

If a student did not feel comfortable with the school environment having them be at home in their space, and area it could show a lot of postive results to other parents and students. Students wouldn't have to feel groggy in the morning or be late to any class since they could just be at home and take everything at their own pace with a specific time end date of course.

Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the eledtors where they vote between a President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The Electoral College has about 538 electors a majority of 270 are electoral votes is required to elect the President by which your state entitled allotment of electors equals the numer of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. The 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of the Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College.

678A6C5DE012,"Conclusion.Say if there was to be a tie in electoral votes, the election would be given to the House of Representatives.

The cars that Google is manufacturing are attempting to use half the fuel of a regular car while providing a safer function. With computers that can regulate exhaust, it is not too hard to imagine in the near future, if given more research, that a self-driving car could accomplish such a feat. Driverless cars would also be more efficient in that they would cut down on transportation time between destinations.

In 2000 17 states didnt get to see any candidates, because the candidates didnt consider them big states.

On the off chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors in the first place? It dopends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the states partys central comitee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always.

If there is a situation that the driverless car cannot handle, there could be accidents and damage. However, driverless car developers continue to address this problem, and solutions have been proposed. BMW has announced that they have developed a car that can drive itself for speed up to 25 mph. They also require that the driver keep attention to the wheel, and will notify if there is a situation where the driver must take over.

We should be able to practice what we want, when we want, without having to be fearful that others might punish us baised on what they practice.

728DD08A8342,"Conclusion.for example ""if you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry. You'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry.""(qoute form source 2) Those 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry may not win the statewide election. The voters also are not always able to control who there electors vote for. ""Legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" (qoute form source 2). So there a chance they may change there mind and the president they wished to win may not win because the legislatures do not have to vote in there favor.

780B302C5523,"Conclusion.if you are in a constrution zone or near an accident the car has you take over. The car isn't full capable of handling driving in a situation like that. The car lets the driver know when they should take over. So the question is "" If the car is driverless how come you have to take over in certain situations""? Why can't the car handle it all on its own since the car is smart? For the driverless cars to be very smart they need a bunch of sensors.

My postion on driverless cars is I think they are a bad idea. They can't fully handle all situations. Also if the person behind the wheel is drunk or worse and they come upon a bad accident "" What will they do""? "" How will they act""? Since the car can't handle itself and the driver is incoherent I dont think the ending result will be very good at all. ",3,0,161

7863164BA896,"Conclusion.Many lower class students or students with parents unable to work feel the need to obtain jobs outside of school, ranging from part-time summer jobs to full-time year-round jobs that inhibit the ability to pursue an education. Distance learning allows these students to do both at the same time if they have the desire to do so, instead of having to go to a program such as night school in order to catch up on work they usually do not have time to do. Distance learning essentially unlocks the ability for students working outside of school to continue to pursue academics while also maintaining financial balance for themselves or others. ",3,2,111
7863164BA896,"Concluding Statement.To sum up, the opportunities for students with work hours interfering with school, mental health disorders or various illnesses are all benefits for the usage of distance learning within the American school system. Although some find distance learning to only further complicate the process of education for students due to some not having reliable access to WiFiÂ or internet, different accommodations are usually available locally for students to use distance learning as a tool to further their education.

The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors.

The meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President. The counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The electoral College consists of 538 electors. The mjority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the President.

Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the DistrictÂ  of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word ''state'' also refers to the District of Columbia.

The presidential elction is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in

If we do not learn this earlier in life we won't have the knowledge and care to do it later in life. Teaching this lesson about community service to children could cause a chain reaction. They could teach their friends the lesson, and they could even teach their children in the future. ",3,2,72

7A2D0B189298,"Conclusion.How is it fair to Americans, if you say we have a vote that counts when we are just voting for a slate of people that might vote for someone we do not want. The voting process needs to be handled by the people, and who we want to run this country that we live in. ",3,0,57
7A2D0B189298,"Conclusion.Yes, sometimes people do not know what they are voting for and why, but that is because we have no say, it is not up to the people who is going to the president of the country of we live, because the electoral college will not let us choose who we want. ",0,0,53
7A2D0B189298,"Conclusion.So if we are not going to have the same votes number of votes no matter what why does it matter if we give the people the option and have them vote for who they want, it is because the Electoral College does not care who we want they choose the president on who they want. Also, if it is up to the Electoral College then why does it matter if the citizens vote, I mean of course we want to give our input of who we want, but it does not matter, because our state senators will go behind our back and vote for someone we do not want.

When driving a car you have to be alert. Not only for yourself but for others around you. When I drive my mother always tells me to watch myself and the people around me, because you may be paying attention, but others might not be. When growing up getting and driving a car at 16 is almost every teenagers dream, but how will the future teenagers of the world get that experience if we have driverless vehicles?

The Electoral College is a process developed by the makers of the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. It consists of 538 electors with each state holding a certain amout of these electors based on the population of that state.

7EE7A20BBBD4,"Conclusion.The first example appears in the method of the ""...""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate""(Office of Federal Register 7). Because of this system, Presidential candidates may not feel the need to campaign to all people, just those of the states with the highest amount of electoral votes(Plumer 13). This goes against the american concept of ""all men are created equal"", leaving voters feeling undervauled and not important. Second, ""A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number.."" (Posner 18). Although this tie is claimed to be ""highly unlikely"". However, an election by popular vote would make the conundrum even further unlikely by the general logic of the fact that it is a lot less possible for the opinion of an entire nation to be split down the middle than that of 538 electors.

8A63149E402C,Conclusion.For example In my ninth grade biology class we had to dissect a frog and organize it's organs. During the assignment I learned more about that frog than I could anywhere else because of the hands on nature of the assignment. This just goes to show that if we started using distance learning courses they would miss out on the hands on portion of learning. ,3,2,66
8A63149E402C,"Concluding Statement.
Distance learning in theory is a great idea because of how convenient it is, but the main reason why distance learning would not benefit students is because of how convenient it is. So to sum up schools should stay the way they are and not offer any distance courses because of how it would change what we are able to learn. ",1,0,63

Online classes can solve this as they can give a sense of friendliness towards strangers. ",3,2,61
8D0E03A58CC9,"Concluding Statement.As I mentioned, online classes are popular and do benefit students. They do this by helping cut costs and help save them money for things they need most in life, flexibility to make up work and to do things that they need to in life, help a student build or gain confidence, and allow for multitasking. This all helps a student get through a class by improving the class conditions, or by making it more comfortable for them emotionally. Though online classes aren`t in person and some classes are not very flexible, they can help shy students feel less worried. And as I mentioned as well, there are a lot of schools that may offer the same class with better flexibility than the school you want to go for that class.

Overall, online classes can help a student get through a class cheaply, confidently, with flexibility, and with the ability of multitasking.Â  ",1,2,154

Probaly not they think that the car is so perfect they probaly didnt stop an think safety.

Google came up with the idea that when the driver should be prepared to take over the car flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays will appear thats a bad idea I say that because what if the lights appear on the dashboard an the driver begans to take over an soon as the lights go away the driver hits another car or a pedestrian?

90981BB41313,"Conclusion.The electoal college process consists of the selection of the electors,meeting of the electors where they vote for president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress, Stated by Source 1 #2. Picking the right electors is very important because they are basically picking our president. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how he electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. As stated in Source 3,The electoral college is widley regarded as an anchorism wich is a non democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled byÂ  declaring the candidate who recives the most popular votes the winner, but the electoral college is not democratic in a modern sense. The electoral college in my opinion is organizing and put together, it is way more stable and puts our country in the right place. ",3,1,150
90981BB41313,"Conclusion.In most presidential elections the presidents are elected by the percentage of popular votes wich I dont think is right. For example as stated in source 3 # 1, Obama recived 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney...Because almost all states award electoral voted on a winne takes all basis, even a very slight plurality in aÂ  stste creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is an even number, but its highly unlikley. Most times the 2 candidates running for president try to persuade the people and some people are fooled by ones promises and when that candidate gets electedÂ  the people do not like the outcome wich messes up alot. The people should go by the important things that the cadidate say they try to fix, not by the promises that they are making to get it done for sure. Stated in Source 3, It can be argued that the electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate whp has no hope of carrying their state democrats in texas, for example, or republicans in california. Knowing thier vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay atteneion to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular voters vote swings a national election, and in spite ofÂ  that, about one half the eligible American population didÂ  vate in 2012's election.

Instead of going through this whole process, would'nt it be less of a struggle to just have citizens vote for the president of their choice and win by popular votes? Also stated in source 2 ""Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" This shows how the Electoral College is difficult to understand for some people. The Unites States consists of many people who come from other counrties and speak other languages. This makes it even more complicated for some to understand even if the process is translated, and just by eliminating this process, it could make Presidential elections less complicated. ",3,2,129
9165D265E932,"Conclusion.Everyone loves the idea of being able to stay home and complete all of their work from home. Sounds good right? Well it might not be as good as you think it would. Being home schooled, as some would call it, is not as beneficial as someone would think. Yes, the idea of having to wake up in the morning and go to school is hard for most people, but in reality going to an actual physical school can help you in many ways. Some people argue that even though this might be true it's still better for kids to do their work at home. ",4,2,106

916958737B60,"Conclusion.Another factor is getting more sleep. Typically when teachers ask how much sleep their students get at home the in my experience the usual response is five to six hours. The recommended amount of sleep teens should be getting at least is eight hours and at most ten. The teachers on the other hand aren't surprised by those numbers the students come out with due to how many of them play sports and take AP classes. This can also cause a lot of stress like on test days, important sports competitions, or cramming in assignments last minute because other classes are assigning multiple projects due in the same week.

91B1F82B2CF1,"Conclusion.In the real world, employers are not going to wait around for whenever their employee wakes up, they are going to set a time when the employee should be at work and expect them to be there. Employers aren't usually looking for candidates that show up late to interviews or employees who show up late to work every day. Not being punctual can not only hurt people in their professional lives, but also in their personal lives. Friends, family members, and significant others are going to want to invite their loved one to breakfasts, lunches, parties, and more and are going to be upset and angry when they show up late or not at all, which could end up with that person losing a lot of people whom they care about ",3,2,132

91B1F82B2CF1,"Conclusion.People who attend online school may feel like outsiders in these groups of students of which all go to the same public school. To add to the social skills provided by public schools, students even attain social skills just by showing up and interacting with their peers, teachers, and administrators. Students who are schooled online may not know what type of relationship or the nature of interactions they should have with future employers or coworkers because that is something that puclic school students practice every day without thought, therefore it is not in the curriculum for the online students to learn ",3,2,102
91B1F82B2CF1,"Concluding Statement.Ultimately, there are benefits and disadvantages to both online and public school and all students are different so it is up to parents and students to communicate and find what is the right choice for them.

9329A9DD13F2,Conclusion.Students should have the option to attend class at home ,5,0,11
9329A9DD13F2,"Conclusion.Students miss school for many reasons, such as illness, travel, or family struggles, and each of these possibilities are often unavoidable. Classes at home would allow more flexibility for these students. In all cases, the ability to be at home would also allow these students to work when convenient, whether it is when they are feeling better or they have down time on a trip. Students should still be allowed absences in certain circumstances. If they miss a class, rather than having all of their work piled up and having to schedule time with each teacher, they can do the work from home, not having to worry about the schedules of anyone but themselves. A great example is students with poor immune systems that get sick quite often. Depending on the severity of the illness, students who are home sick could attend classes without the fear of contaminating others or getting exposed to worse germs, and allow them to avoid a place that houses countless bacteria and viruses that could cause an illness at any time. ",3,2,177
9329A9DD13F2,"Conclusion.Not only this, but on a day that a sick student stays home from school, they often have periods of feeling better and having more energy, so these periods could be utilized for working on classwork, a luxury that is not available in a school building. If this same student were taking classes at school and missed an assessment in class, they would have to schedule time outside of that class and coordinate to find a time that is available for both them and their teacher to make up the work. However, if this student missed an assessment that was online, they would be able to make it up any time that they are free, not having the restrictions of seven hours of a tight packed schedule or specific times in the day ",3,2,134

9447D5C6EA03,"Conclusion.The development of a new, self-driving car that functions efficiently is being tested by various different companies, like Google and General Motors, but what practical purpose would this development solve?

9447D5C6EA03,"Conclusion.The creation of driverless cars should not be further developed, despite potential increase in safety, due to the increased dependency on technology it would facilitate, as well as liability issues regarding crashes or other potential accidents, both of which could negatively impact other aspects of the future.

9447D5C6EA03,"Conclusion.however taking this concept while maintaining human control could prove to be more benenficial, due to the lack of issues such as liability and also keeping humans active and engaged.

Ultimately, this potential asset is far outweighed by the costs of producing driverless cars. ",6,2,69

94B72A7C1E6B,"Conclusion.In 2008 when Barack Obama won his election to become the 44th president of the United States, he didn't win by being the popular canadite, Obama won by his passion to make this country better than it already is. For example, in source 1, the text reads ""The electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electorial votes is required to elect the president"". That way of electing the president is more fair than a popular vote because you need 270 electors to say yes to make you president rather than people making you president by if your popular or not. Electoral College is what keeps our elections fair. There is no other way to elect somebody president becuase no other method will be this successful than Electoral College. After all, Electoral College has been the way to elect the president since the constitution was created. Popular Voting is a bad method if were used to determine the president and vice president because somebody who is running for president can manipulate people to think he or she is a good canidate for president when they really aren't. ",3,0,190
94EFC5F3ABB2,Conclusion.Some belive that the electoral college is a good idea Because of the voting way in the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors. which is good because people need to have a leader of there state and that leader shows them which president is really good for whta they do. Presidents talk about what they are gonna do to help the country and the slate elelctors define what the presidents are gonna do to help out that certain state.

Source 1: What Is the Electoral College?

"" The Electoral College is a process, not a place."" Some people might not understand that. It also states that it consists of selections of all the electors, it is also a meeting place for the electors to vote for the President and the Vice President, and it also used for counting of the electoral votes made by the Congress. At the Electoral College also consists of 538 electors and the majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the President. Every candidate that is running for President in your state has their own group of electors. They are usally generally chosen the candidaate's party. ",3,1,122

998B12C291DD,Conclusion.If students do not already have a B average then how can they keep up their grades when they are participating in activities? Students need to learn to organize their time between activities and schoolwork. So not only will they learn to organize their time better but they would also be getting better grades. ,3,0,55
998B12C291DD,"Conclusion.The students who are very dedicated to the sport or activity that they love would definitely push themselves for better grades. I believe that some of the students who participate in the activities at our school do not have a B average. Most likely because they are so dedicated to their sport that they forget about the schoolwork. If one of these students found out that you are changing the rule then they would change their attitude towards school so that they will not get kicked off their team.

99C687C4B554,"Conclusion.Another reason to argue for home-schooling is because of reduced stress. Some may say that the levels of stress will be greatly reduced in the comfort of home without the constant distraction of other students and the demands placed on students by teachers. While this partially might be true, more stress is caused when a student does not know how to manage their time wisely. Home-schooled students are at a greater risk for this because their are also many distractions at home such as cell phones and social media. ",3,2,90

9C9F8BC72552,"Conclusion.Cell phones should only be used after school hours, dismissal, if they need to get a ride home. Other than that it is not necessary to have phones in school and be using them to talk to each other. Kids would not be following the rules made if they could have their phones with them, they would carry them and never turn them off during a class. Teachers would have build-ups of students phones because the students basically would care about when they could use it, they would do as they please and get their phones taken away. This rule would probably effect most high-school and middle-school students, not elementary students. The older students would not be following rules and would act as though they do not care about the rule, all they'd care about is the fact that they could have phones. During classes like gym and health and foreign language people would use their phones because people would not care about those classes, they may see it as a free period like a directed study/study hall.

But other teens are getting looked up to by doing different amounts of work to help out, and also adults think they are a good reputation since they help out more. ",3,2,81

It's process consists of the selection of the electors, a meeting of the electors where they vote for President & Vice President, & the counting of the votes by Congress. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 votes is required to elect the President. In the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Colubia is allocated 3 electors & treated like a state for purposesof the Electoral College. The word ""state"" also refers to the District of Columbia. Every candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. Presidential election is held every 4 years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. When you vote for President you help choose your state's electors because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. Most states have a 'winner take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. ",3,1,182

Plus, the cars will be able to see almost as much as their human counterparts as long as their radars, such as the LIDAR, are powerful and accurate enough to send an accurate reading back to the computerized vehicle.

9FE339BCFE2C,"Conclusion.Although you may think you are voting for your choice of president, you are not.Â  As of now, when you cast your vote, you are actually just voting for your candidate's electors, as said in ""What Is the Electoral College"".Â  In the 2000 campaign, voters in seventeen states didn't have a chance to see the candidates at all.Â  Those candidates went mainly to the ""swing"" states, or states that were not certain on who they would be voting for.Â  The states unvisited, such as Rhode Island and South Carolina, were passed over because the candidates knew they would or wouldn't have their vote no matter what.Â  The ones who questioned their vote did not have the chance to see either candidate in their state.Â  In, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"", the Romney and Obama election is mentioned.Â  It brings up the fact that Romney knew that throughout the South, he was going to get their vote.Â  He realized that there was no need to go there because he didn't need anymore popularity in the South because he had already gained their electoral votes.Â  Those who opposed Romney in the southern states felt that their votes would not matter because majority already knew they were voting for Romney.Â  If the system were to change, which I believe it should, more people would feel their votes mattered no matter what state they were in. ",3,2,245
9FE339BCFE2C,"Conclusion.The slate of electors is not picked by the people.Â  It is said in, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid jdefenses of the system are wrong"", that sometimes the state conventions, the party's central committee, or the presidential candidates themselves choose who will be their electors.Â  That being said, you don't know whether or not the electors will follow your choice of president or not.Â  For example, in 1960, some electors refused to vote for their party's candidate and they chose whomever they wanted. If we were to switch the way things are now, that would not happen.Â  A poll taken in 2000 called the Gallup poll, showed that over 60% of voters prefered a direct election rather then the kind we have now.Â  This took place when Al Gore recieved the popular vote, but lost the electoral votes.Â  You can see that the current system has its flaws.

This can be predicted by looking at the accuracy and speed of reaction when looking at an automated calculator in comparison to a human arithmatic. As time has progress, so has technology up to the point where it surpasses human intelligence and reaction speed, and in the case of these new cars, would make it generally safer for the extremely accurate computers to do the driving, rather than humans, who would make a great many more faults when it comes to driving safely and accurately ",3,2,119

A2237589F0FE,Conclusion.If you made it to where kids with C grades couldn't play sports it would may make some of them try a little bit harder ,2,0,26
A2237589F0FE,"Conclusion.If the school did set this rule up then there would probably only be nine or ten kids that would actually be involved in the activities themselves. I said earlier that a D is still a passing grade, and it is. I mean it definitely isn't best passing grade, but it is better than an F. F stands for fail. This rule they could put up is basically saying ""if your not a straight A student, then you cant do anything fun"".

Now this is all just my opinion on it all, there are a lot of facts involved to of what it would do to the school and its community though. Like it is said, many students have a grade C average. When I say many I mean a lot! I am also one of those students who has a grade C average so that's puts me on the side of not liking this idea ",3,0,157
A2237589F0FE,"Conclusion.The reason I say that many straight A students wouldn't like this idea is because they would probably seem to be labeled as nerd's even more than they already, dumbly enough, are. ",3,1,33

This car had special touch sensors to make sure thatthe driver keeps their hands on the wheel. The cars could steer,accelerate, and brake themselves, but if there were any traffic incidents, the car would require human skills. This means that the driver would have to stay alert as if they were driving. To keep the driver alert, GM has developed seats that vibrate the driver's seat when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The google the car announces when the driver should be prepared to take over the wheel.

But people up north thought that would be greedy and our nation needs a president for all. It was a situation that he would only apply or do anything for the south but nothing for the north. So candidates with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a succesful president. ,3,0,74
A3D23CFB2043,Conclusion.People in the toss up state are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign to really listen to the competing candidates knowing that they are going to decide who gets elected.

If school is canceled for inclement weather, many students might lose power or internet service and not be able to get work done.

Students who have to travel often due to highly competitive sports do not have time to work on assignments while at tournaments, games, and competitions, but coaches for clubs and travel programs have rules about the grades their athletes have to keep to be able to play and travel; this will keep athletes from getting far behind and from being unprepared on graded assignments on new subjects.

A47BE7BB6F08,"Conclusion.Voters are actually voting for the slate electors who in turn elect the president.

For example if you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for John Kerry you'd vote for the slate of the amount of democratic electors that are pledged to Kerry.

Such as more breaks, better food options for lunch,linear schedule, and starting and ending time being optional. If students are learning a specific lesson by a video conference they wouldnt benefit the lesson as well as being offline. ",4,0,88
A67D3F549FAD,Concluding Statement.Distance learning shouldn't be an option this is important because it can affect the way kids learn and how they understand it. Students can be thinking of the lesson in a different format than how the lesson is expressed in the video conference. It was important in the past being it wasn't and option because they didn't have the technology resources that we have today. It helps in the future because instead of going to college you can take an online college class and you would already have experience from it. If you are attending classes from home then you switch your routine and go to school you are going to be more experienced with online conferencing and you are going to be wanting to do everything on your own.Â    Â  Â  Â  ,1,0,132

There are many thoughts about this subject, which is about the Electoral College. The Electoral College in some cases is a good idea, and in some cases, to some people, its a bad idea.

If I wee presidnet i would want everyone to feel welcome and wanting to listen to what I have to say. Not saying that they would all like my decisons but I would want them invloved, I beileve every president should want their citizens involved and do be able to stay up to date. Statistics show that it has been argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canidate who has no hope of carrying their state.

A98E8EFFC8A9,"Conclusion.Driverless cars have always been a big idea for the future. However, there are some really important pros and cons for driverless cars. Driverless cars can be very dangerous to not only the individual driving, but also to everyone around. ",4,0,41
A98E8EFFC8A9,"Conclusion.Since a driverless car would be driverless, not only the driver would need to be alert but everyone around it would need to be, which is common sense for any type of vehicle or transportation. Considering the fact that the human being is always in charge of an accident with a regular car. That woudn't be the case for a ""driverless car"". Now even though the driverless car have sensors and other types of monitoring to prevent accidents and disfunctions, who's to say the driver isn't paying attention when they need to be and something goes wrong. In paragraph 9 it talks about how traffic laws are wriiten to assume that the human is in control at all times. That's completely understandable, if the human doesn't do what he needs to do to make sure his manufacturer is working correctly, it would be his fault for not taking care of it. ",3,0,152
A98E8EFFC8A9,"Conclusion.No matter how well the car itself is functioning, you dont know if everyone else is paying attention to their own vehicle. Pedestrians around the driverless cars have no control over what it does. If something happens to a pedestrian, who's responsibility is that? If a sensor on the car isn't working properly, which it should be, there would be more deaths and injuries to people around the vehicle and to the person inside of the vehicle. The minor issues of a driverless vehicle could cause a huge problem. ",3,1,90
AA0FF7AA95C3,"Conclusion.I have a very strongly worded, persuavive letter written for you today of why our united nation, must abolish the electoral college. I am aware that the electoral college is one of the main ways president's become elected, but it's serving an unjustice to our nations people. You must do something of the crisis that our country is facing with the Electoral College. ",4,2,64
AA0FF7AA95C3,Conclusion.I have two compelling reasons of why the electoral college should be abolished. ,5,2,14
AA0FF7AA95C3,"Conclusion.My first reason of why we should abolish the electoral college is because of the method it is done in.  What I mean by this is, according to Source 1:What is the Electoral College?, it says, ""Most states have a

""winner- take all"" system that awards electors to the winning presidential canididate."" The winner- take all system is not a fair way to elect a president becuase of its biases. ",0,2,72
AA0FF7AA95C3,"Conclusion.The candidates running for the presidency only visit the largly populated states in order to get their electoral points, for instance, most candidates go to Californa or Texas becuase those are the states that have for electoral points. But, by doing this all the smaller states that have less electoral points are never visited by the candidates, the voters then may have never seen an ad or campiagn for a certain candidates . According to Source 2: ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"", by Bradford Plummer, it states, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and votes in 25 of the media markets didn't get to see a single campiagn ad"". On the contrary, it is stated by Source 3: In defense of the Electoral College, it states,"" No reigon has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" This is true, but candiadtes focus on larger states that will supply them with more electoral votes, and don't even visit or pay any attention the smaller states. I strongly negate the Electoral College. ",3,2,194

",6,0,9
AAA72CBAC7F8,"Conclusion.No one really knows the elctors and they cant be seen holding public office. It depends on the state to pick the electors and voters cannot always control whom their electors vote for. In addition, as Bradford said ""voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidates"". These disadvantages may want to make people disapprove of The Electoral College disregarding its advantages. ",3,0,67

AAA72CBAC7F8,Conclusion.The last two reasons are the big states and avoiding run-off elections. ,0,0,13
AAA72CBAC7F8,Concluding Statement.These five reasons make the electoral College what it is now. Most voters dont watch the Presidential campaign's and chose whoever. The Electoral College is fulled with educated people who actually take the time and watch and study the campaign's so their vote is the vote that makes a difference.

The Electoral College is regarded as an anachronism that should be overuled. Its declaring the canidate with the most vote to be the winner, which is not really giving the citizens the chance to vote for they want to be their president. Advocates are arguing about the Electoral College not being a modern sense, and how it is the electors voting for the president and not the people/citizens. When citizens vote for the president they dont actually know that theya re voting for a slate for the elelctors. ",3,0,125
AC2463899B0F,"Conclusion.Just like the dispute over outcome of votes that happened in 2000 can happen again, because the electors are not being fair with the votes.

AC78193CD7B9,"Conclusion.Some teens have sports, commitments, and maybe even part-time jobs.

Others may have to watch their younger siblings at home because their parents come home late at night and are unable to care for the little children.

Therefore, teens in these types of situations would not be able to do any community work, or they would have to give something up, like a sport that they love ,or a job that they need to support their family. ",3,2,78

AD1914496798,"Conclusion.In an election their really is a process of voting and voting again. Instead of couting the number of people who want a certain president and so on. We are viewed as a state and some states having more say than other even if the votes are in the same margin. This is the reason why some states are focused on more by the candidates and are heavily educated on the topic and given more attention than smaller states whose votes wont change much. an even bigger problem is te fact that most states operate on a winner-take-all basis so even a slight majority vote one way will give that person all of the votes. A very worrying prospect as expressed in source two is the possibility of a tie. in which the election would be given to the house of representatives. Each state only gets on vote so a representative representing 500,000 people would have as much say as representatives representing 35 million people. ",3,2,167

AFBEA4BA2D3C,"Conclusion.In the text it stated that ""None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"" meaning that at some point the driver would have to help the car navigate at times when the car couldn't(7). Which imposes that the drivers would have to be aware of his/her surroundings at all time when the time was needed for them to take the wheel again. But, doesn't that defeat the purpose of the car being driverless. No one would want a driverless car that still needs to be driven? ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive""(8). And the most important question is, what would drivers do to pass the time when they're not driving. They could distract theirselves with their phones, music or any passengers which could cause them to miss out on any important message from the car telling them to drive or take over in the needed situation. This is where the reckless aspect of the driverless car comes in. Missing the important message could cause accidents and harm to other drivers or pedestrians. And, this cause of harm to others around leads to my next argument against driverless cars and that is lawsuits. ",3,2,230

B27585EF3751,"Conclusion.There is no way to be assured that the person you voted for, or anyone else, was selected. We need to ask ourselves what the best thing is for our country... letting everybody be dissapointed in who was voted for, or seeing that they got what they spent time on going and voting on. This isn't just a captain for a football team, or a manager at work. This is the president of the United States, and he or she will be running our country for 4 years or even longer, so we need to question this method of voting. We are a unified country, and our unity shows what we want as a country..we shouldn't have one thing chosen and get something completely different in return. The election by popular voting would be a better overall choice for our country. ",3,0,143

I know that there are more efficient and fair ways to do this, all we need to do is use them.

B29198FD0748,Conclusion.The first reason i feel we should overthrow the Electoral College is becasue it is discriminating states votes based on there sizes. ,0,2,23
B29198FD0748,"Conclusion.Â  In the article,""Does the Electoral College Work"", it states that becasue of the diffrent sizes of our states some people feel they do not get a fair say in who makes decisions for our country. They feel that because they dont live in a big state like Texas they do not have equal say in the decisions our country makes. In the article Plumer wrote, "" In the same vein, faithless electors have pccasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they please..."". The Electoral College is changing peoples mind set on how to vote because they feel why should we care if the government does not, can you blame them? If we just took out the simple problem of the Electoral College more voters will vote honestly rather then go with everyone elses vote. ",3,2,145
B29198FD0748,"Conclusion.What i mean is ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Americans have always wanted to be in power and have a say in what we do but in the case of voting we do not. By doing this we are allowing the government to make all of the decisions for us, as if we were children. When you turn to the legal age for vothing your vote should count. With this majority does not rule, for instance say our votes of 46 percent and 54 percent were to come in. The man of the 46 percent still has a chance of winning when the people had already voted. The problem with that is at that point the peoples word goes out the window, and the government once again jumps in demanding that they choose. ",3,2,152

B36C72D38CBC,"Conclusion.The excitement was short lived for us because we ended up saying that ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa"" so that made it disappointing for us. You may say that the landform is created by aliens and we're just hiding it from you, but you're sorely mistaken because this discovery would help NASA as a whole if we did reveal it. That's just one of many reasons that we aren't lying about it being a landform. ",3,0,79

B36C72D38CBC,"Conclusion.Like we said during this speech we said that ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform."" Later on we did it again in the speech ""Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,"" Said Garving. ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" Now you may say that we never did that, but we have photographic evidence of that clear photo that lets you see everything on the face. So we have the evidence we need to prove that this photo is real. ",3,2,194
B36C72D38CBC,"Concluding Statement.All together we have the proof that this special land formation on Mars that may look like aliens have built it, but it's just a simple mesa here on Earth something so common. ",1,0,35
B37483011EC6,"Conclusion.There are many reasons is to why we should keep the Electoral College up and running. My personal opinion is that if we don't keep the way it is going, things will become wrong. I have many concerns that i'm going to be sharing with you. Hopefully you will understand.

First, Electoral College has 538 people in the congress working to count the votes that people make. The most votes a President can get up too for winning is 270 Electoral votes. ",3,0,83

B3948CC26153,"Conclusion.If, in case of a tie, we due a tie braker as you will.Â  There will be a revotation process with 499 voters, these voters are picked at random in the city data base.Â  ""...for example, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him.""

B3963F9DB39C,"Conclusion.No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his pularity in states that he knows he will win."" A presidential canidate should be able to gain votes from his region because that is the states the canidate are more familiar with so, he will be able to campaign better in those states and if he becomes president he will be equal to all the other regions. You could avoid this with the fair method of popular vote. ",3,2,110

This mental disorder could and often will impact their learning, not allowing students to reach their full potential. If being in a school with a large number of students is upsetting to them, they could take their classes from home. This would allow them to still be able to pursue an education while not being in a triggering environment, which could make a large impact on their grades. In the comfort of their homes, students would be able to move at their own pace to make sure they know the material, stimulating academic success.

Other students wouldn't have to make a choice to pursue an education or care for their sick relative. Some students wouldn't have to choose between their mental health and the opportunity to go to school. They wouldn't have to run the risk of getting other students sick and missing valuable school time. Instead, they would be able to do classwork from home which would make it significantly easier for these individuals to go to school without sacrificing anything. Online classes would allow all students to have an equal opportunity to have an education, regardless of circumstances that would hold them back should distance learning not be available to them.Â  ",1,2,162

B6D776FC5087,Conclusion.The ones who don't know what an electoral college is we will get there soon just stick around. I am arguing that yes we should keep it because its important. The electoral college is the right to selecting/voting for president and vice president and people like that. Now to began on with the reasons i think it is important is that's a sign of are freedom to me that gives us a right to vote for who we want running this economy. Not being able to vote for this kind of thing could be bad because when we vote for the people we want running this economy we are choosing wisely because we don't want this town or anything to come crashing to the ground because of some man or woman who really doesn't care about the people they just want their name to be heard. ,3,0,147
B6D776FC5087,Conclusion.When someone votes to me that's a good thing because we have went through all this freedom stuff and then were able to vote and no many people want to vote that's pretty ridiculous if u ask me that's a sign of freedom like I've said before and when we go through a lot just to get u this grant of freedom and people just throw it away that's a sign of disrespect. I know that me being young and not able to vote yet and probably not making any since at all is probably making who ever is reading this mad but i wasn't put here to be taken right back out at a young age i was put here to live a life that was chosen for me and when people who are to dumb to realize it don't vote or at least don't try makes me mad because their not seeing what there doing just going in there and putting what ever name down on a ballot is wrong but going in there knowing a little information and choosing the person you think would make a good leader is fine. ,3,1,194

BECFCA5BFABD,"Conclusion.Now yes i understand that maybe some dictators through out history may have needed to take a step back and really see how their environment was hurting and try to change it. But why did most tyrants in history become tyrannic? As children they felt like everyone was against them, they felt closed off from everyone else, and maybe that wouldn't have happened if the home that they grew up in, and the town that they were raised in was cleaner and safer.

For example look at Josef Stalin, who killed more people than Adolf Hitler. Josef had a tough childhood, he had to fight just to stay alive. He earned everything he gained. But after he became the man who had everything he started turning into the man who lost everything. Now I am not a fan of the practice of communism, but the idea of it is great. No one should be turned down due to economic problems. Everyone deserves a good opportunity.

Some people just cant help if they start out with a disadvantage. But sooner or later everyone has a chance to make something of themselves.

Whether their chance be a job, an education, a family, or a military service to their country. Everyone has a chance to mean something to someone. I mean isn't that what we all want, to matter? Some people have stronger drives for glory than others. Look at Achilles for instance, he wanted his name to live through the ages, and he knew that the Trojan War would help him with that. But with glory always comes retribution. Fame and demise have gone hand in hand through out history. ",3,1,279
BECFCA5BFABD,"Concluding Statement.So basically what I'm trying to say is that community service is only used so that people with disadvantages should be able to acquire those advantages, but no matter where someone comes from, what race or creed they belong to, everyone is a product of their environment.

This would require students to have to focus on the purpose of school, learning, before anything else.

Also, if students have a grade of a C, then they should have to spend the time they would use for sports or other activities to raise their grade.

''Your states entitles allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation; one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators.'' Just the way this is set up in Congress, the same amount of power for each state is applied for choosing our President for the next four years.

Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. Your states Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. Voters can expect close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. Under the electoral college system, voters don't vote for the president, but for electors, who in turn elect the president. The electors can be anyone not holding public office. The person who picks the electors in the first place depends on the state ",3,0,115
C48AEB2F1FC2,"Conclusion.The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the electoral college methodis not democratic in a modern sense, it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate, youre actually voting for a slate of electors.

The electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Your states entitled alottment of electors equals the number of its congressional delegation: one for each member in the house of representatives plus 2 for each senator.

Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Let us going back in time to see how did get here.

Also, the people who used to do community service will probably lessen their amounts of community service because it will not make them feel proud, so they would feel they are just doing extra for no reason.

C93DCEE52172,Conclusion.By the way plurality means that when a candidate receive more votes than other candidates while not receiving a clear majority of votes.

CAE2A78F6FF2,"Conclusion.The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal."" ""This is a desireable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" This shows that it is beneficial because it makes a candidate who has only regional appeal, have to work harder in other states to show that he would be fair to all states, not just the ones that support him. Furthermore, it allows for massive regional advantages, like the South, mean nothing because they would still have to convince the North to vote for them. ",3,2,98
CAE2A78F6FF2,"Conclusion.The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution."" This shows that large states can sway the whole election, while small states don't make a dent on it, without the Electoral College in place. Thus, using it allows smaller states' votes to matter in the election, while eliminating large states' advantage over them ",3,2,74

I'm dying here,"" mom says.

""Yeah, I'll be back in a bit.""

I grab my keys from my pocket and head outside. I unlock my new driveless car and climb in. ""Take me to the CVS,"" I tell the car. It roars to life and backs out of the parking lot. It's been not even two miles and this thing is starting to glitch. ""You will be taking possesion of this car in five minutes, ma'am,"" the car commands. I panic and take hold of the violently shaking steering wheel. Traffics harsh tonight meaning there's some kind of party out in town. The driveless car just unexpectedly starts going in the wrong direction, making me go in shock.

Before I do a full turn I see a lady talking to her baby inside the car. I try to brake, but it just won't budge. I pray that I won't do any harm to them. Unfortunetly it does. I run smack into the front rear, making me black out. They say that before you die, your life flashes back through your eyes. But mine didn't.

How could we let majority of citizens vote but not get the person they choose ",3,2,63
CBC776495BE0,"Conclusion.The electoral college imposes on the American freedom and right to choose their president. The United States of America is a representative democracy. The citizens choose who they want to lead but those votes aren't truly their own votes. According to Richard A. Posner of source 3, ""...the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidental candidate, you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" American citizen votes do not matter as much as we think they should. The founding fathers built this country for the people. The people should have an actual voice in who they want to lead this great nation. In addition, Americans should have a direct say. Votes should go straight to the president and not the party's electors. This is not only fair to citizens but also a more relible plan. Bradford Plumer of source 2 explains to us that """"faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" We can't depend on these electors to determine one of the most important things of this country. We can't depend on these ""faithless"" electors to vote who we want when they might do the opposite.

Electoral vote, the thing that determines who becomes president, is done by the Electors determined when voters chose which candidate they wanted to win. Electoral vote, and popular vote are not the same thing, for instance one could win the popular vote, yet lose the electoral vote. Why is this? ",3,2,109

Students can't have fun with what they're learning if they're stressed. Having a lot of stressful causes students to not do well in school.

Do you think someone who is extremely bad, for example someone who is always getting in trouble in school for misbehaving, should be allowed to be rewarded?

Well that is not right because he thinks that he can be bad and do anything he wants and still be rewarded in the end.

He is not being taught anything and it isn't fair.

How would you feel if you were a student who did good in school, got good grades, and tried your hardest while some other student did bad and took the easy way out and was rewarded in the same way? ",3,2,119

D1ACADAC5ED4,"Conclusion.To protect those who fear going to school because they are constantly putting themselves in danger, the school could give them this option of learning from home. There are so many stories of kids getting beat up at school and the school not trying to fix things or not being able to fix things, and this is a way that the schools can help be a part of the solution. There are also numerous stories of students getting sexually assaulted and raped. These students go through every day, trying to avoid those horrible people who did this horrible thing to them, wondering why they have to put in so much work just so this doesn't happen to them again. The book

Speak brings a lot of light on this issue. The main character goes through this avoiding process and, in the end, is unable to completely avoid her rapist. She finds it extremely difficult to see him in school, acting as if he hasn't done anything wrong. If she was given the option to do online schooling, I bet she would have done it in a heartbeat. She dreaded going to school every day and this extra option would have been a godsend for her.

D9436DDEB3C4,"Conclusion.The ""electoral college"" is a very non-democratic way of selecting your president. In a way the government is deceiving their citizens by the way our voting method is set up. When people vote they feel a sense of independence because they are allowed to choose who they would like to represent them in congress.

For example, a teacher can watch you in person and closely, but the teacher through the screen can only see what you show and not your full body as in person. This shows that cheating could be a major key flaw to online courses and shows that it does not very well help a student learn or understand in any way possible.

These states are putting their people at risk just so they can find all the flaws of the car. Most people will agree when I say that is it really worth the risk of a human life just for a car that can drive itself but not really control itself.

Now, it is only fair to say that everyone has a different and unique way of learning, whether it be through hands on activities, trial and error, or just being told what to do. The demand for these needs is high due to the rising population in public schools, and not every student's needs can be met at all times. Some of the students may struggle based on how the curriculum is taught in one class, and excel in another one taught differently. It all depends on how each student receives information the best.

""Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote..""(Posner). So these Electoral College followers agree with the electors actually selecting the winner because they don't have to do anything. People can just sit back and watch the electors take the power, while the others do nothing but be slumps. In source one, the Office of the Federal Register mention that ""when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."", which means that if voters have friends in the position of an elector, voters might just vote for the elector because theres nothing else to really pay attention to.

Online classes tend to be a very tedious and a independent responsibility that requires a ton of focus and self-control. Generic_Name did not have these qualities. Because Generic_Name took online classes from home and obtained the qualities of having no focus and no self control, she did not take her online classes as seriously as she needed to.

E3E96A297604,"Conclusion.The electoral college is basically us voting for electors,not the president. The electoral college is not a good system to use beccause just like the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College"" says ""Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate?"". What do we do then, we can't take back our vote. This is how some presidents win without even knowing we messed up on voting. ",3,0,73
E3E96A297604,Conclusion.A prime example of why the electoral college is a bad idea is when Al Gore lost the election in 2000 against Bush.

(Paragraph 13)

This is ridiculous and not at all fair to voters. In this sense, it is absolutely true that every vote doesn't count.

E4FC29A88EDD,"Conclusion.All throughout the article the accidents in the future were expected. which is why the companies wish for the human assistance to be alert to ""take over"". However, when observing that statement closely the accident would be caused by the car itself due to the fact that it drove in such way. The weather could be an out of control factor involved and if the car does not drive in a way that considers that, then the fault is on the car. The same can be said for a car collision. If all of the vehicles in the world are driven by themselves, then it would be the cars that caused the collision. Paragraph 7 touches on the liability issues of situations similar to those mentioned. The issues surrounding the driverless cars are preventable by not producing them at all. That way there is no room for error when it comes to the safety of those on the road. ",3,2,160
E4FC29A88EDD,Conclusion.Paragraph 8 discusses making the driving fun by entertaining them. Whereas Paragraph 7 is about the driver taking over and the different functions to make them aware. The key to having the person aware of the dangerous situation is to not have them distracted in the first place. Plus that prevents any accidents if flaws in the warning system should occur. The reason there is a long lasting trust in human judgement on the road is that the people have a chance to take action quick enough. If they were not previously paying attention due to the driverless car then that chance is wasted by them attempting to figure out what the situation is in the first place. Eliminate the possibilty of that irresponsible lack of attention by having the person drive to begin with. ,3,2,136

E51722919697,"Conclusion.Going to the practices and attending all the meetings is a requirement to obtain your membership to the group or team in most cases. Being obligated to be present at these events ruptures the time we have to study. In order to hold good grades, you have to be able to prepare for the assessments that will be given to us, which counts a lot towards our final average. If you strongly believe this is a good policy to enforce, you must allow a bend in the academics then.

When you give more students the chance to be a part of something, you gain a better ratio of the school succeeding. When the School succeeds in certain sports and clubs the school will gain recognition, good recognition. Along with the recognition, we could win money, money is always good for schools because there is always something that can be bettered with the appropriate amount of funding.

Also, giving students that may be struggling the chance to be a part of a sport or club could spark a greater interest in them. It could inspire them to set higher goals for themselves and to encourage them to do better. Joining a school sport or other activity may give them a desire to pursue what they are doing in that sport or club. Say someone becomes a part of the robotics club, they grow to love what they are getting the chance to do. because they love it they may grow up to me an engineer.

In this statement the Office is stating on how whichever party a person might be in, the electoral college will come through.

The bell signals and the sound of shuffling papers and zipping bags begins as people pack up for their next class. The teacher bids farewell as their students trickle out the door into the busy hallway. StudentsÂ chat as they meander to their next classroom. Settling down, they pull out their notebooks for their lesson. The teacher begins, interacting with them and receiving questions. While this seems like a standard snippet of a high school experience, there are many factors that would be lost if school began allowing the use of distance learning ",4,2,95

E85C45D90D1D,"Conclusion.Secondly, a schedule is very important in maintaining a balanced day. Having classes aligned for the week can enable students to practice time management and help them be alert for appropriate times throughout each day. To my friend, having a schedule is extremely important. Without one, she gets concerned that she will not be able to accomplish what needs to get done. To combat this fear, she creates lists, with scheduled times, that allow her align her personal schedule with her tasks. Similarly to my friend, students need to able to see what they need to learn in that day and get it done. They can work on getting to class on time, and due to breaks and meals throughout the day, they can relax knowing that their time is planned out for them. This ability is lost when students make choices as to when they feel like taking their online or video conference classes ",3,2,156

E862C9EC5EC5,"Conclusion.I belive that each of the electorates should only have a certin percentage of the votes example: Alaska has 3 electorates, each are assigned 33.33333...% of the population and of course due to the decimals one electorate will have a bit more votes all the votes are then added. 76% voted Republican while 22% voted Democrat and the remaining 2% voted for third parties then the first elector would recive the votes of the 22% and the 2% and do fill up the rest of his 33% he would have 9% Republican his vote goes to the Democrates but the other two are left with only Republicans so there are 2 votes for republicans and the learger the population the more electors because of the increased ammount of citizens that each elector votes on behalf. This way the indivaduals that voted democrate are shown but did not really make as much an impact but it shows and may decide the out come during a tie ",3,1,168

Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Most states have a 'winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate.

E899EF61626A,"Conclusion.Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors. Statisics show that Congress would get 34 electoral votes but they aren't really voting for the president. For Instance, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. That many voters vote on one party for president and another for Congress. ",3,0,74

I think that you should believe that is not aliens because if it was aliens dont you thinl they would be doing more than just that? That means if it reall the aliens who made this they must have a lot of thinking and knowledge about stuff like that. That also means that when earth moves the face moves with the Earth.

If you are given the chance that your car does not need you and you do get bored off of the heads up display, what would you really do? Since our society is all about iphones and samsung , I do not think that its safe to be in a car with your cell phones on.

EA5BFD706570,Conclusion.This leads me into another benefit to online learning. Another benefit to online learning would be that it is a potential stress reliever or minimizes stress. ,0,2,27
EA5BFD706570,"Conclusion.Many students may feel better and be less stressed doing homework or school work, because of being in the comfort of their own home or in a space that is safe for them. Students feel free to take breaks and not be restricted to the overcrowded rooms that are common in regular schools. It's also proven that surroundings have an effect on mood and willingness to learn. If the atmosphere of a classroom is sad, depressing, or gloomy, then students may have a gloomy or depressing attitude when in that class, hindering them from learning at their fullest potentials. With online schools, the student chooses their place of study and knows what places motivate them to create high quality work and retain the most information. ",3,2,126
EA5BFD706570,"Conclusion.When doing online school, the student doesn't have access to a tangible teacher or access to a teacher 24/7. Sometimes students will have to wait for a teacher, if the teacher works for both online and public schools, to answer a question that the student has on a problem or concept. Sometimes students will have to figure out the concept themselves which develops their problem-solving skills. The independence and problem-solving skills can become useful later on when the student applies for a job. Many employers like employees who don't depend on the employer for everything but can try and solve problems on their own first. For example, when working at a McDonalds drive-thru with a line full of people, the employee doesn't have time to be asking the employer a series of questions if a problem occurs. Instead, the employee must find quick solutions and learn independence. The employee won't learn unless they try it. ",3,2,156

Cars the can sense when the car needs to break if the driver is distracted. Brakes that are anti-lock which means they distribute different amounts of braking pressure to wheels that may have more traction to prevent loss of control. ",4,0,64
EBD070DAE867,"Conclusion.All of these things are very good for cars and keeping drivers safe but are we close to seeing the ""Driverless Car""? ",5,1,23
EBD070DAE867,"Conclusion.If the driver has to sit at ready all the time then how is it a driverless car? As a driver, I know what I am capable of and I feel best when I am driving and I am in control. It would take a whole lot of trust for me to just turn my car on autopilot and let it take over considering there are many things that can happen while you are driving down the road. Many questions come up, such as, Will the car react in time? Will the technology even know to react? Will the car safely and controllably avoid whatever obsticle is thrown it's way. All these things change if the driver is sitting back not driving because the car apparently can do it all by itself.

Eventually, in the future, it is very possible to see cars with an autopilot function or other self-driving techniques but we are a long way from cars driving without human help. ",3,0,164

Although, it is up to the student whether or not they will allow their classmate to get them off task or ignore their distractions. In some cases, the student can be responsible enough to but in others many students may find it difficult.

It balances the votes by a larger state compared to a smaller state. In article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to kep our despised method of choosing the President"", the author states that a larger state has more popular votes rather than a small state. The author says this, ""The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes."" As that being said, the author is explaining how larger states get more attention from a presidential candidates in a campain than a small state does. This is when the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment. ",3,2,165

Kennedy thus proving that the electorial college cannot be trusted. Another reason why the electorial college is unfair to the people is because of the winner-takes-all system in each state due to the candidates not being in the state and focus only on the race between ""swing"" states.

F6F60CA6E983,"Conclusion.It keeps a steady stream when it comes time to vote because aslong as someone had 270 votes you know thats who will get picked. so why try changing that and have a whole new system put in and then not know what to do when it comes time to vote. And what if the new system dosent work, what if the new way of the voting process messes with the tallys and they come out wrong and no one will get picked, unlike the other way when u know everything will come out right and u know that we will have a president. I think its fair that they have it set at 270 for voting that way everyone havs a chance to vote instead of it being so low that only a few people get to vote before they shut it down because they have reached there number of tallys that they need.Â  So if they change the number of tallys that a president needs to become president that will be stupid and people will act out on it because they wont think its right, and because the people who didnt vote will not like the fact that they didnt get to put there vote f in before they stoped the voting and because they meet the number that they needed. Its a vote why do they need to title it as a the vote of a president or a popular vote of a president. Why not just vote for there just electors instead of saying vote for your candidate when really you are just voting for the electors. If you are voting for a certin thing there is no reason that u have to re-word it just to vote, if you are voting for something do it the right way instead of changing stuff and making it seem one way when really its the other way. Why should the electoral get just as much as the winning presindent? They are not doing as much as the presidentÂ  and who is helping him out.. so they should not get the same reword.    ",3,1,355

They vote for who they believe would lead our society and modern day world in the right direction.

I'm sure many people in those sates such as South Carolina and Rhode Island had a lot of input to add in the 2000 campagin but because they were little minority states they werent focused on as much as the other larger staes. This is very unfair and judgementally to these states because the Electoral College is based on involuntary effects, the inhabitants of North Caiolina or Rhode Island cannot control where they choose to live, they might have to live in the certain geograpic location because of finaces or religous persecution.

Posner states, ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a poltiacl preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election"" (Posner 1). The Electoral College makes sure that every person and state vote is accounted for and will be contributed to who the next President will be. One day maybe there will be a process that will exceed the Electral College, but for now, we will trust our founding fathers and keep the process that has been with us since the start.Â        ",1,2,135

03BA5E41C5E4,"Conclusion.Taking classes at one's home would distract students physically and mentally, making it difficult for them to be totally immersed and invested in what they are learning. Even if it is unintentional, a student will rush through their coursework in order to move on to something else more interesting; like playing basketball, watching a movie, or even just eating lunch. In a traditional school setting, class schedules keep students and teachers alike focused on the task at hand. Similarly, it gives them a clear time to take much needed breaks. An environment dedicated to learning lets students know that, when they come to school, it is time to learn. This separation of work and play is much more productive than working at home. So much happens at home. People eat, sleep, hang out with friends and family, cuddle with pets, have good conversations and bad conversations; the list goes on and on. Trying to do work in an such a busy and dynamic environment makes it hard for a learner to dial their brain into the current task at hand.

Personally, I think that asking people for advice can help you make a better choice, because the people you ask have most likely been in the same situation as you. ",3,2,80

Despite the increasing lack of these traits in the youth of today, the world continues to demand them.

For example, if students have pets or younger siblings in their households; the students will not be fully engaged if the pet or sibling is entertaining the student. A school campus, a resourceful learning location, is a better and more useful learning place when being compared to someones home or comfort place. Another concentration concern would be the inability to interact through online classes. When students stop a fluent rhythm of learning, they zone out and find something to do that entertains them. This would unbalance the online class' pace with the student's pace. Once students are out of focus, the only ones not benefiting are the students who are not at school learning in the classroom.

07CF059A90F6,"Conclusion.I have mentioned before, I am taking an online class. I decided to take this class for the following reasons: to experience online school and see if it was adequate for me and to get this class done this year so I could focus on more specific subjects my senior year in high school. I started the course through a platform called vision used by Generic_School, which is both an in-school class resource and a online class tool. As far as I have been experiencing this new learning format, I have found many advantages to it. The course i'm enrolled in is self-paced, meaning I can do my work when suggested or work ahead if I have the time, which I have had. This doesn't happen often to me because I always find myself stressed during school hours, not thinking of learning and working ahead, but thinking about the time I can get our of the school's campus and go home. This is something thousands of students in this school had felt or are feeling. I have made a research paper describing how decoration and lighting in a classroom affect significantly the learning process of anyone at any given time.

Decisions are like lights, our own minds can defy us and twist our vision to make them appear brighter or dimmer. They can blind us from everything else going on around it, and make it impossible to see anything else until we turn it off. For example, when I was playing in a championship game of a soccer tournament in sixth grade, some of my team-mates did not try and play their best because they were scalding hot. They did not realize that this choice would cause us too lose, they thought their laziness would have no impact, but in the end, with three of our players walking up and down the field, we had lost, and were ashamed. Every move we take in the game of life affects not only ourselves, but the world and the people around us. Outside input in a decision can help us to see clearly though the light.

The reason that one person asks for advice could be because they don't know what shoes to wear, or it could be because they need advice about something bigger, like what house to buy. Either way, they are still seeking other people's opinions. When you are asking a person for advice, you want a definite answer.

15EAD0CC9F3D,"Conclusion.Normally, when they return back to school, the students would encounter a myriad of incomplete work that had accumulated over their course of inactivity. The pile of work would be required to be completed if they wanted to maintain their grades all the while having to simultaneouslyÂ obtain the current information and tasks the teacher was distributing to the rest of their peers during that time.

I do agree, though, that there needs to be some rules so people won't take advantage of everything. Distance learning is the very middle of those two extremes, understanding that one has the power to be anything they want as long as they work hard, while also knowing that there are still certain tasks they need to accomplish, and certain rules they need to abide by while doing said task. If we all let the small stars shine, they will shine brighter than any other. ",1,2,109

If school rules or strict bell schedules are holding a student back from their highest potential, there is no reason they should stay there.

What is accepted in the United States may not be considered normal in India, or the other way around. On a smaller scale, this may be lessÂ evident, but the research still applies to a great extent. If only one source is questioned, what they see as okay may not be seen the same way by another source. For this reason, it is hard for most people to switch societal views and morals. A study conducted by Generic_Name shows that when people are shown a different viewpoint, they tend to stick with it after being presented a new one later.

It can help you learn, be sure of something, and give different ways on how to do things. Many people already ask for multiple opinions and with the internet there are so many people to ask. So next time you face a dilemma or problem I hope that you will ask for many people's opinions. ",1,0,72
287F79B6D6F6,"Conclusion.Many students will agree that a commonly enjoyed perk of going to school is to meet and mingle with friends. However, when students study on an online forum at home, they do not get this opportunity to engage in conversations with peers as there are lesser chances to forge a personal bond with the students in the class. If learning online removes some of the greatest opportunities a student has to establish bonds and friendships, is it really worth it? Students need to know the faces and personalities of the people in their classes to gain a confident observation of each of their classmates' beliefs. Lighthearted conversationsÂ with one's peers are a key to developing relationships, and without the assistance of such relationships, students are likely to lack motivation in their goals and studies. Additionally, students will lack motivation in their coursework if they have less need to participate during lectures. An online study forum greatly hinders a student's ability to communicate with peers and take part in group discussions. These discussions are essential for a student's success in core classes as they captivate the student and make them play an active role in the class. Being an active learner provides students with the necessary skills to communicate with the professor and their peers, as well as to actively observe the essential components that are being discussed in the classroom's environment. The lack of opportunity to discuss topics with another student can create an uninteresting perception of that class and make students less inclined to partake in class activities and lectures. Therefore, students will not benefit from attending classes at home as they will be less motivated to partake in the class when their abilities to create relationships and be an active learner are hindered. ",3,2,296
287F79B6D6F6,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion, students will not benefit from attending online classes at home as they will get easily distracted and be less motivated to learn. If students are to properly balance their home life and their studies, a more reasonable approach that doesn't compromise their relaxation or student life needs to be found. Also, students who attempt to take an online class at home are more likely to be distracted by the comforts that are at their reach. The inability to forge relationships and connect with peers is another drawback of taking an online class at home. Likewise, the lack of opportunities to partake in in-class discussions creates barriers for students to succeed as active learners. Nobel Peace Prize winner and educational activist Malala Yousafzai once said,""a paper and pen can change the world."" Yousafzai overcame many hindrances before she could provide education to the girls in her village, so why do we undermine its importance? Education is a powerful tool that we must use to guide the future, it is not something that we can compromise on for comfort. ",1,2,183

28823EC65BA2,"Conclusion.Education like many things has had a traditional way of being however, like many things nowadays that tradition is prone to change and it is for the better. Technology is one of the most important and useful tools in todays society and schools are already utilizing it and it utilized even more so by home schoolers. Since the courses are essentially entirely online, teachers can use many online softwares to create fun, educational, and dynamic learning activities rather than simply assigning worksheets or textbook work. The online systems can help students with writing papers and with calculations in math all while explaining why things work the way that they do making the teacher's job even easier ",3,2,117

29687C1F98F1,"Concluding Statement.Although the idea of not attending school and staying at home all day is a dream for many students, it fails to serve the same benefits to students that regular classrooms do. When comparing distance learning to classroom settings, it can be seen that learning in classrooms is a much more beneficial option. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because there would be no face to face interactions with their instructors and peers, there would be no hands-on-learning within their class lessons, and students would not be able to become used to a college setting after participating in distance learning for a long time.

People have their own personal opinions and they will sometimes tellÂ you something that you do not like or want to hear . Now if someone gave you advice that you do not like do not ignore it take it as constructive criticism and listen to what they say and have a open mind about it. For example: Lets say you made some food and you add a little to much salt and your friend tells you that it is was to salty and that maybe you should have added less salt but you find the food to taste just right. Next time maybe dont add as much salt. This way you listen to your friends advice even though you disagree and if you find it alrightÂ and if they find the food better then you both dont lose nothing. And theres other ways to deal with this situation like not cooking that meal, but you decided to listen to your friends advice and in the end it all worked out. Its ok if people have different opinions then you and their advice isnt what you would like to hear but its good that you learn from them. ",3,2,223

355534539B7E,"Conclusion.sometimes a problem can only be solved when you take a step back and try to look at in a new way, and talking to multiple people concerning the topicÂ can help someone do this. For example, say someone got into an argument with a friend after being offended by something the friend said, after they talked to multiple people about this they then could see that the friend didnt mean to offend him/her. If the person had not gone to someoneÂ else forÂ advice then they wouldn'tÂ have realized that the friend was sorry and didnt mean to offended him/her, by talking to multiple people it helped them make a better choice.

",3,2,163
3579E5EE4EC8,"Conclusion.When receiving advice, the response you get will be different from everyone. This is because everyone views things from a different standpoint. Some people think it's best to keep their not so positive opinions to themselves, while other are going to share everything with you. It's important to have both these kinds of people in your life, because they're both needed in different situations. Let's say, for instance, you get a new shirt that you absolutely love. You probably want to hear from your peers that it looks great on you. Now, let's say you are shopping and find shoes that you aren't too sure about. In this situation, you're probably wanting to hear from your more honest friend, who will truthfully tell you how they look ",4,2,128

3579E5EE4EC8,"Conclusion.The examples I listed previously were very simple. Sometimes when you are in need of advice, the scenario is slightly more difficult to deal with. A lot of people deal with drama between peers. When these things occur, it's very helpful to have multiple friends whom you can talk to. It's hard to solve a problem when it comes to people, because everyone has a different relationship with each other ",3,0,71
3579E5EE4EC8,"Conclusion.If you're talking to your parents they might give you different advice then a friend might give you. Generally, parents will be a little more comforting and give you good advice about not worrying too much about it, while a friend might know more about the person whom you're having issues with and give you more advice on how to actually solve the problem. Both these opinions are great, but they're both different, which shows that it's important to have both these opinions rather than just one. It's also very important to have someone who will just listen to you, while others will do the talking while you listen to them. It's also a good idea to get advice from both males and females, because they tend to have different perspectives, whichÂ can be beneficial in certain situations. ",3,2,139
370732B4F376,"Conclusion.Having different options when making a decision is very important because there are open choices that are good and bad. Every day people ask for advice whether it comes from finding what clothes to wear, to asking for advice if you should get married or not. That benefits a whole lot because sometimes all a person needs is a barrier to select between. Imagine if a person was at the store trying to buy something for their mom on her birthday. The person had to choose between a hand bag or some expensive sunglasses they had found; although, they didn't know what to get her. However they brought one of their siblings to help choose. I think having people to help you make a right decision every once in a while is necessityÂ in life, even though you don't want to get overly used to it. ",3,0,147
370732B4F376,"Conclusion.It can help if you have a friend or family member you can trust that has a strong opinion, because sometimes you need it. There is always going to be a couple or strong people in your life that's going to help you make right decisions either if you are going down the wrong road, or if you are doing the right thing in life and you just need motivation. If a person was struggling in high school and they really needed to step up their life and grown up more, they would really need to good influences or somebody to tell them where they are going wrong. People that can step up with their own voice on the situation that has known the person, and that could really help them get their life together. Personally, the type of people everyone needs is somebody that has strong beliefs and values and that would care for their loved ones.

But there are so many other people you could go to that would save you so much time and effort and they would give the exact same response as your parents. I believe you should always go to a separate opinion from that of your parental guardian and what you will find when you do so, is these other sources can teach you a lot more than your family and they have different experiences from those of your parents. your parents will always want the best and nothing more from you but think to yourself, ""do my parents really care about my issue or are they just trying to make me feel better about the problem at hand.

Your friend or close peer, like a teacher or coach will want to understand your issue and they want to help you at all costs because they know that your a good kid and they never want to see you down,moody or upset ever. Your coaches put you through struggle and so do you teachers so they know you can handle the hard moments in life and want to always help you, so you can make the right decision. whenever you hear a question in class you want to seek understanding about the question so you can answer it the next time someone asks. The issue hear is very similar to that and when you have a problem or issue that you believe needs a second opinion they will always be willing to listen. That way they can ultimately impact your decision for the better and you will be so relieved and you will ask yourself why you didn't go to them earlier ",3,2,212
3EA7F29FFED8,"Conclusion.having that skill can make some of the tough decision seem very easy. The moment your eyes become fully opened to the different outcomes of what you could say or do based on a simple decision. You start to almost think more logically when you are given the task of answering the hard questions about yourself and you realize that all the decisions you make, impacts you and only you so don't worry about someone else when making a decision about your livelihood. This will ultimately always end up as a better decision because you took the time to hear another way of solving the issue and you can factor that into your decision making and how you will handle the problem you needed to get advice about.

3EA7F29FFED8,"Concluding Statement.I personally have always believed in the idea of going to a second opinion about an issue and I always want to help people with their problems just like they help me with mine. You should never discredit your parent or guardians opinion because they could ultimately be correct when it's all said and done. However the minute you start only listening to your parents is the minute when your friends lose trust in you, and you lose trust in them. Remember that whenever a conflict is resolved or your problem is fixed you always have to credit someone for helping you with your problem and if that person is someone other than your parents than you have learned that your peers may be less experienced but they could be just as wise and just as intelligent as your parent or guardian. Finally when you make your ultimate decision based on the advice you were given you are very well informed and you can learn the different perspectives and different lessons that can be taught by different people and you come out of the experience so much wiser and smarter than you ever were before.

Scientists have proven through various studies that being comfortable while working has a direct effect on ones ability to produce quality work. By giving students the opportunity to work away from school, the comforts of home will aid in excelling the learning process. Students are also fed ill-nutritious foods in unnaturally short lunch periods, causing masses of students to consume foods that decrease brain power. When students are given less then 15 minutes to stuff their faces with greasy carbs before being shoved back into their classrooms, the students ability to work is compromised in ways like never before. By allowing students to work at home, they also have access to more nutritious food with reasonable eating periods. ",3,2,175

The freedom of learning online allows students to work at a pace that is comfortable for them. This by itself eliminates assignments such as ""busy work"" given to students that fully understand the material faster then others. This also allows students to fully understand the material before moving on, instead of rushing to keep up with a class that is moving to fast to allow a struggling student to keep up. Some students are very intelligent and work well in higher level classes, but simply need slightly more time to practice and understand concepts then others, which is a matter that online classes solve completely.

It started out with my grandma, Generic_Name, being about twelve years old and not knowing what to do. She needed advice. My grandmother decided her best option was to ask multiple people and see what they had to say. Initially, she decided she would talk to her mom, my great grandmother, and she told her a story about what she did and how it went well when she went through the same experience. Next she decided she would talk to her dad, he told her the same story that her mom told her but from his point of view since he never had to deal with it. Her next choice was to talk to her best friend, Generic_Name, but she had an awful time with this when it happened to her, yet Generic_Name still gave her advice.

One person is greater than two. If anyone were to ask a group of three. With you making four, there will most likely be a tie. Lets say you pick blue and one other person goes with you, that remains two more and they like orange. that means there is a tie.

4B47096239FB,"Conclusion.When a student has depression, anxiety etc., they often find themselves unable to attend school for a full day, or even at all. Likewise, if they are present, they cannot focus and by the end of the school day, they are so mentally and physically exhausted that they cannot get their homework done. Their grades suffer as a result. With distance learning, they can work at their own pace, taking the necessary breaks when needed. The individuals would not be concerned with falling behind, because they would be able to do the work when they were mentally stable. Mental illnesses are just as serious as physical illnesses, and the act of physically going to school can be detrimental to their health, and to their grades. Online schooling would allow them to achieve a stable well-being, and a higher state of learning. ",3,2,142

But if they consulted many advisers before making that vital decision, the advisers might agree with the president, resulting in the president feeling more confident with their decision and ultimately leading the country better than if they just went with what one person said and didn't ask multiple people for advice first.

4C471936CD75,"Conclusion.if I'm not sure what college I want to attend, and I ask one friend where I should go, they might say ""GeorgeÂ Mason"" as a suggestion. But if George Mason is not in fact the best college for me, even though the person I asked was trying to help, that one opinion could sway me to go there anyway and not have the best experience. But yet if I go to ten people to advice, including the person who suggested George Mason, they might be the only one who would say that and maybe five of the other people I asked might say Virginia Tech, and I would decide to go to Virginia Tech instead of to GeorgeÂ Mason, and I would overall be happier and maybe even get better grades. Then I would be more successful because I went to multiple people before I made a decision that could affect my entire life. So therefore even though one person still has a chance to give valid advice, it is safer to talk to multiple people because it increases the chances of making a bad decision.

Lastly, one of my friends suggested I attend Generic_School because I will have friends going there and I will be given the chance to improve my art. In the end, I decided I would like to travel to Colorado. Even with the possible downside, Colorado is my favorite place and I would be happy to return again, as I have not been there in years.

People usually start building their social skills when they first start school, where they interact and communicate with their peers. Students miss out on this opportunity when they only learn by clicking and scrolling on a screen in the vicinity of their home. People often get comfortable with isolation and adapt to being alone and never learn how to communicate properly with others. Lacking these skills can effect the long distance learners' performance at job interviews and daily tasks that requires them to speak to others around them. This could result in them missing out on the opportunity to flourish in the career field they studied hard for and the opportunity to develop good relationships with other people. ",3,2,142

For example, a month ago, I was in the process of selecting my courses for freshman year, but I was unsure if I should take regular Geometry or Geometry Honors. So, I found a time to meet with my guidance counselor and asked her for her personal opinion. She believed that it would be a mistake if I took the honor class because she was afraid that I would be overwhelmed with the workload. After some thinking, I decided to ask for advice from my math teacher, who encouraged me to enroll in Geometry Honors because she'd noticed that I've consistently maintained outstanding grades since the beginning of the school year. Finally, after listening to both sides, I decided to take Geometry Honors. ",3,2,147

For instance, a couple of months ago, my friend Generic_Name was struggling with drafting her college resume. She was at a disadvantage because she didn't know what steps to follow to write her resume, and the worst part of it all was that her school guidance counselor was unwilling to take the time to help her. At first, she attempted to write it herself without any guidance, but then her old friend, Generic_Name, who already graduated from college and is now an English professor at Generic_School, was visiting during that week. He noticed how frustrated she was with her essay, and decided to sit down with her and give her some pointers. After finalizing her resume to the best of her ability, Generic_Name decided to make a copy of it to give to her English teacher, Ms. Generic_Name, who is a notable alum from Harvard University. Ms. Generic_Name gave her some feedback, but overall, her paper was ready to submit. Generic_Name sent it out to Santa Monica University, and received her acceptance letter a few months later.

6867D67B3444,"Conclusion.If a student was answering a question where a picture was shown about dissecting on a test for her anatomy class and it was asking where one of the incisions should be cut she would not have been able to answer it due to the fact that the closest she had gotten to seeing a dissection, was by watching the video provided by her teacher. In classes such as math, it would be hard to teach the kids online when a subject such as that involves a lot of hands-on practice to fully understand the concepts. Because they are taking it online, there is no way for them to really get in contact with the teacher considering they may live many states away or even countries! How can you learn from your mistakes if you do not know what you are doing wrong and what you can do to fix it if you are unable to talk to the teacher about it in person. So it is logical, that online classes do not give students the ability to achieve to higher standards because they are not able to learn as well if they are not learning from their teacher in person.

This is due to the over usageÂ of technology to communicate rather than face to face interaction. Most people when asked when they have talked to others in person answer with either in school or in a place of business. We can't revert the effects technology has had on society but we can surely stop it from getting worse. Implementing distance learning would only cut off a form students from getting an already stagnant amount of social reaction that is needed. Thus leading us to an even more depressed society. ,3,2,141

Some parents tend to job the gun when they take a look at their grades and are seeing their kid isn't doing too well, but what they aren't always considering is the other factors that go into it. A students grade could be reflective of not only their work ethic and focus, but how well a teacher is teaching them, and the sort relationships between other kids in the class. If a parent is able to be present when a student is working on their courses, they would be able to get a full scope of how their student learns. Not only that, but the student would have less distractions from other kids, and hopefully be able to avoid some of the flaws of an individual teachers style of teaching. ",3,2,163

81EB648B5B51,"Conclusion.Many times throughout a school year students are given projects to work on as a group which not only allows for the students to meet new people in their age group, but also allows for them to develop communication skills. These projects typically have some sort of reflection at the end so that the students are able to discuss who in the group put in the most effort which encourages all of the students in the group to try their hardest and collaborate with each other. Part of this collaboration involves working around each others schedules and sacrificing time to check over each others work. Sadly, the skills learned from these projects cannot be learned when utilizing distance learning. Not only are the students unable to meet up in person to discuss their project, but online schools typically shy away from giving group projects due to the difficulty to work around other students schedules. Thus, distance learners are taught to be independent when completing work which can only serve to hinder them when they enter the job force. ",3,2,179

On a daily basis, students do not attend school for various reasons. They either have family emergencies, appointments, or an illness. Often, students take their missed classwork home, to finish on their own time. While only a handful of students make up classroom time, the majority still refuses to complete missed time. For instance, students in my classes reach no credit status and about 1 in 10 of them care to finish their missed work. ",3,0,76

872A3AAEC127,"Conclusion.It's no surprise to anyone that bullying and harrassment goes on, not only in adolescence, but all throughout life for some people. If a child was facing this type of harrassment in school, the ability to take classes from home would eliminate that stressor for them. They wouldn't have to worry about coming into class every day and having to confront their bullies. This would be beneficial for a multitude of reasons, and it can also be a preventative measure to ensure the safety of students as well. Peers have an enormous amount of influence and power over the actions of certain individuals, and being forced to interact with that kind of behavior all the time could potentially pose as a threat. Being taught at home gives students the ability to control who they get to see and when, and for some people, it is absolutely necessary for them to have this option. ",3,2,154

This generally entails posting pictures or videos, having sponsorships with companies, and interacting with their fan bases. Another common facet for this lifestyle is travelling. With all of this extra work these influencers choose to incorporate into their lives, school becomes a lot harder to maintain. Online based learning, in this case, makes it a lot more accessible and easy for these young kids to finish their education while still pursuing their dreams. ",3,2,97
872A3AAEC127,"Concluding Statement.Overall, online and home-based learning proves to be very advantageous to a mass of people all over the world. Whatever the circumstance may be, merely having the option to opt out of standardized in-school learning is a very forward and advanced way of taking into consideration the needs of others. It gives students the opportunity to become confident, feel safe, and even pursue their dreams. For these reasons, I believe being educated from home is an exceptional concept that is appreciated by many. ",1,2,85

87328D07C574,"Concluding Statement.As long as it might take to gather, more opinions matter. Multiple opinions matter because it show the true opinion of the ones involved and affected. Bandwagons must be considered into data because some will choose the side most picked. Choosing the best choice is interrupted by bandwagons that should be acknowledged into a final choice.

897004C788FB,"Conclusion.In a Presidential vote, does the country ask only one person about who they want for president, or the whole country? You could only imagine what only having one person's opinion could do to this country. Having people vote as a whole seems to be very beneficial to America, and may be beneficial to you as well.

897004C788FB,"Conclusion.This takes some stress out of your choice because then you know what the majority thinks. At the end of the day it is still your choice to make, regardless of what anyone thinks or says. There are an endless amount of decisions that people seek personal opinions on no matter how serious. When you're going out to eat with a group you ask them where they want to go. The NFL or NBA Most Valuable Player isn't chosen by just one person, it's asked about by fans, coaches, and players to see who the majority thinks deserves it. Now this does not guaranteeÂ the right choice will be made, but in the past it has proven that it has the potential to be helpful. ",3,2,126
897004C788FB,"Conclusion.These different viewpoints could really effect your on view on a decision. Many people make poor choices because they are biased towards what they think is right. Most likely you will not get the same opinion and view on a situation over and over again. No matter how you look at it it's beneficial. Either you receive the same view over and over and it makes your decision very clear, or you get different viewpoints and a new way to look at the situation. ",3,0,85

This has happened to me before and resulted in me losing lots of money. If you ask one person then another person ones advise might be better than the other one. So what if you didnt ask both? One time a friend told me to jump off the roof, but my other friend said us the ladder and I used the ladder and made it down safe. You could also ask three people and one isnt good at giving advise one is okay and the other is good dont you wanna ask all three so you can get good advise? This is usually like my friends vs. my parents. This is my second reason why I think you should ask multiple people. ",3,0,151
8F8BCC081DC6,Conclusion.In other nations home schooling is illegal so students have no choice but to attend public or private schools. In the legal states students can be home schooling for many reasons. Some reasons can be like parents not wanting their kids around others while learning. Other reasons can be dealing with being kicked out of school and no other schools will accept you because of behavior. In my society today I know a few people that have been kicked out school and forced to be home schooled online. ,3,0,89
8F8BCC081DC6,"Conclusion.It can be good for students that don't learn well at school, but bad for those who learn well in school. If kicked out others may need more help and start to cheat on the work and look up answers. Causing them not learn as much as they did back in public schools. So if students know they wouldn't be able to learn well with a online teacher they shouldn't do anything to get kicked out school. ",3,0,78

93DC556B7C04,"Conclusion.Many famous people who became famous for their work of whatever expertise they acquired usually didn't ask for just one specific person's idea. They saw many people's criticism to something that they made, and they improved their idea gradually, such as

The Simpsons.

When they first made the main characters, it seemed to be poorly drawn and the voices were weird, but as the episodes went on and on, the characters and voices had smoothed out and improved to what they are today. Having one person to ask for your opinion can sometimes be just the right thing to make your project approved by one person other than you, but sometimes asking other people can give you many more perspectives to look at, giving you an upgraded idea for the one you just had ",4,2,135
93DC556B7C04,"Conclusion.The more compliments you receive, the more people who say they like the idea. Many famous writers used other people's thoughts to see whether or not their book is good, and they ask for their opinion. An example from me is my favorite series of books:

Gone Series.

On the front cover of the book, it has one quote from an author, and on the back there were many other quotes from other companies. Adding to the quotes, on the top of the book said

#1 New York best Selling Book , basically saying to new readers that this series is good and popular. That is usually why on the front cover or back cover of a book contains a quote from different people or companies showing their good opinion about this book, so the readers can see that since this person liked the book, then it must be a good book to read. Having an award on your book also brings in popularity because winning something like the Pulitzer prize can bring a ton of attention to your book. It can give you more to believe in that your project will be good because you have many people who say your project is good. Not just the people who say that it's just ""good"", but also the people who point out the things that they especially liked within your idea, such as, ""I liked how you included this part to make that huge problem go away."" These kinds of compliments makes you feel even better inside, and it tells you that you can take your mind off that one part of the idea and imagine more possible problems. ",3,2,280
94DF4BBF522F,"Conclusion.Children were told sometime in their life that everybody was unique andÂ differentÂ in some sort of way, that there were absolutely no two people that looks the same, much lessÂ think and act the same. This applies in everyday life from then and getting advice is not the exception. Everybody has different beliefs, experience and ways to do things so it's hard to find one person that exactly understand you to the point of giving you advice perfectly. ",4,2,80

94DF4BBF522F,"Conclusion.Even if two people go to the same event, they might still have absolutely separate experiences, because everybody might feel different things at different times. For example, if somebody wants advice on a person, two people might totally different and separate experiences with that one person because we don't behave and react to things the exact same everyday. Asking multiple people will avoid and help you combine the helpful experience and estimate what would happen, where if you ask only one person, their experience might be completely different from you.

94DF4BBF522F,"Concluding Statement.Getting advice is easier to manage and organize if it's from all kinds of different people. One person giving you advice may impact your problem to be even worse because they might have different beliefs, experience and the way they think may be different. The person who has the problem should be the one deciding, and getting advice from one person might pressure them to do what would make their problem worse or not the way the original person might have wanted it to go like.

9627B47C10DE,"Conclusion.Let's say Generic_Name was still unsure about what to do about her toxic friend, she could ask her old friend Generic_Name, who stopped talking to Generic_Name a while ago, what to do. Generic_Name knew that Generic_Name used to playfully make fun of Generic_Name but then one day Generic_Name just left the group. Generic_Name could tell Generic_Name that she went through the same thing and she just couldn't take it anymore and she had to leave that situation. This information could help Generic_Name make a choice because she now knows that Generic_Name has treated her friends like this in the past and that she is not just being sensitive ",3,2,109
9627B47C10DE,"Conclusion.Another example is if you want to adopt a new pet but you don't know if you should adopt a hamster or a bird, so you decide to ask your friend, who has a bird, if you would be a good bird owner. Your friend could tell you that having a pet bird takes a lot of time and you need to be able to give your birds the proper care and attention that they need. Whereas when you asked your friend who has a hamster if they need a lot of attention she said no because they are nocturnal .You know that you're a very busy person so with the information your friends gave you, you can make an educated decision to not get the bird.

97E7DD4E7C69,Conclusion.keeping an opened mind. ,0,2,5
97E7DD4E7C69,"Conclusion.Someone such as a friend will usually ask more than one of his/her piers on their thoughts or opinions on something and will go on asking more people the same question. After, he/she will take all the responses they have received and will most likely go with what the majority of what their piers said. People tend to do this because they want to have an open mind about what a group of people think rather than just one person. Next, why seeking multiple opinions can lead to a better choice. By asking multiple friends, piers, and even family members their thoughtsÂ on something that may or may not be important, it could help save someone from making a bad choice in the future. To conclude everything that was previously stated, Asking for multiple opinions is a great way to double check if someone is making the right choice because they will have stopped them from making a choice that they could have regretted ten years from then.

Most high school students do not put in the effort to dress nicely for school everyday already, they would rather be comfortable then look nice.

You don't want to be in the position where you ask only one person for their advice and listen to them, only to realize they really didn't know what they were saying.

AF9AAA672210,"Conclusion.The first person my sister asked for there opinion was our Grandma. After a while of my sister coming out in dresses the first thing I noticed was my Grandma always asking ""Well what do you think of it?"" before giving her opinion. I think this is a very good way to give your opinion without hurting any onesÂ feelings. You are asking how the feel about the dress before you put your thought in. But there are some disadvantages to that. Let's say she walks out of the dressing room in a dress my Grandma really doesn't like and she asked my sister how she feels about it and my sister says she loves it. Then you have a hard decision to make. Do you say you like it so you don't hurt her feelings or are you going to be honest and say you don't like it with the possibility of making her upset.

B1687066F985,"Conclusion.In U.S. History, for instance, my teacher Generic_Name would talk through the notes very quickly, so it was difficult for me to keep up, especially since I am a slow writer. Fortunately, Generic_Name makes the powerpoints available on blackboard, so I use that during class, but I am so invested in trying to write down all the notes that I miss the important information that he was explaining. In this situation, it would have been beneficial to attend that class from home because I could listen to his lecture intently and then take the notes afterward, which I would not have been able to do in class because Generic_Name disapproves of people not taking notes.

B1687066F985,"Concluding Statement.To conclude, students can reap many benefits from online classes that would facilitate their growth both in and out of school. Attending class online gives the student control of learning in a way that is preferrable to them, which is important because then students will comprehend more and learn effectively, and gives the opportunity to explore interests with the extra time at hand to grow as an individual. It would be an absolute waste of resources if schools failed to take advantage of such technologies that could improve students' education and well-being. Not only is the availability of online classes beneficial to the students, but it is useful in an emergency such as a threat of a school shooting, which is unfortunately a prominent issue and possibility in the modern world, or a viral outbreak.

Seeking multiple opinions can be beneficial to your health and others.

9 out of 10 people say that they make the most effective decisions when they seek others for advice.

They looked interesting and beautiful, but to see what the artist wanted you to see you had to stand on footprints that had been painted on the asphalt and look to see what the mural was of. When you have a second person to give you their opinion it is similar to looking at a mural from a different perspective. The first way that you look at the mural is interesting, but it is even better when you change to where the footprints are: the best choice to stand.

When making a choice some people visit professionals. A few include psychologists, therapists and counselors, they help listen to a problem in hopes of breaking it down and seeking best possible outcomes. These people are there to help drive a path for healthy decision making. Another reason is that knowing other people struggle with things too and that no one is ever alone. It provides at least a little comfort understanding everyone goes through something. Those people who decide to open up about their problems can also help determine a choice.

BB4A53A0A9E0,"Conclusion.While a rarity, there are some areas of the globe where young people are denied the chance to receive an education. This is nearly never the fault of the student - where they live, the government of the country that they live in, and their gender or physical appearance are all traits that they cannot control. When the terrorist group Al-Qaeda was present in Pakistan, many Pakistani girls couldn't go to school or leave their houses due to the militia's belief that women were not deserving of rights or an education. While these girls were being denied the opportunity to be educated, this doesn't mean that they weren't deserving - online classes could've and still could improve that situation. Through the availability of methods to access classwork in the home, children that have been circumstantially denied the chance to attend school could be granted that chance again, and with potentially less risk. Classes taken within the home would allow students in difficult life situations to gain back their opportunity to learn, and continue furthering their intellectual development despite their circumstances.

When I take my own advice, it is often biased towards what I want, and I don't necessarily see all points of view of the decision I have to make. Taking my own advice is beneficial in situations where common sense is used and in situations where I have no one to to ask, such as logical situations or doing school work.

BF619ADE9BF4,"Conclusion.One morning, Generic_Name the Pterodactyl hopped outside of his old nest. The nest has been in his family for generations but had started to wear down. The twigs were falling out left and right and they would poke him while he slept. Not to mention that it was located in a dangerous neighborhood. Generic_Name decided it was time to sell the old nest and move into a new one. He asked his pterodactyl friends where to move in. Generic_Name the Pterodactyl said, ""you should move in with me and we could be roommates!"" Generic_Name thought about it, but politely declined his friend's offer for Generic_Name was a messy house keeper and only played video games. He then asked Generic_Name the Pterodactyl who answered with, ""I know a great realtor by the name of Generic_Name the Velociraptor."" Later that day Generic_Name looked up Generic_Name on Boggle, the search engine for dinosaurs, and found that Generic_Name was a pretty sketchy realtor. Finally he asked his good friend Generic_Name the Pterodactyl for advice. Generic_Name was not only a good house keeper, but also knew the JurassicÂ Area pretty well. He told Generic_Name, ""Make sure to look for nests that are in good neighborhoods and are in good condition."" Generic_Name was a great help, and after many hours of research, Generic_Name was finally able to call another nest home.

Some people often ask for advice from multiple people (or pterodactyls in Generic_Name's case). ",4,2,243
BF619ADE9BF4,"Conclusion.The more trials you have in an experiment, the more accurate your results will be. Let's use Generic_Name for an example. If Generic_Name had only listened to Generic_Name, then he would be up to his ankles in empty potato chip bags and energy drinks. It was because he asked multiple pterodactyls, that he was able to get the right advice. This doesn't mean that Generic_Name was planning on being messy or that Generic_Name was trying to scam Generic_Name. They were just trying to be good friends. From a scientific perspective, when planning a science experiment, you would want to have at least three trials. This is because something out of the ordinary could happen in your first trial and that it usually takes at leastÂ three trials to recognize a pattern in the experiment.

If you are asking for advice - don't pick your favorite person. When I say this I mean people like your parents, your boss, etc. Although they could have good opinions, you might listen to them more than the other people who are trying to give you real feedback. Not only that but you don't want to have a person to lie to you and say that there was nothing wrong with your outfit or that your story didn't have confusing plot lines, when they both do. But on the other side of the feedback spectrum, don't pick someone who is going to crush your spirits. I once had a teacher in 6th grade that inspired me to learn more about the world's history and pushed me to learn. I even considered being a historian when I was older. Then, in 7th grade, I got a 72 year-old teacher who instead of having us learn about the Spanish-American War - stopped the whole class to look at pictures of his grandson. Don't get me wrong, I love looking at adorable picture of babies. But during the year, I lost my love for history and never thought about being a historian since. So what I'm trying to say is that you should pick someone you trust and that you respect and know that they will do the same for you. ",3,2,364
BF619ADE9BF4,"Concluding Statement.To sum up, seeking advice from multiple pterodactyls - I mean people, can give you better and more honest feedback, and can help you decide for yourself. So don't be afraid to ask for opinions because in the end it might just help you soar ",1,0,47

Like I said in sports and In basically anything in life it helps because you will always have choices to make and getting more opinions might just come up big for you.

CF89338D76B5,"Conclusion.Schooling has been around for thousands of years, and, as the rest of society has evolved, the traditional schooling technique has virtually stayed the same. Children still remain at desks, listening to their teachers lecture; kids still take home worksheets for extra practice called ""homework."" Standardized tests are still given, and kids are still excelling. However, as time goes on, more people have begun to question this type of schooling, and why it has not changed for over 1000 years. A recent change people have suggested, with the rise of technology, is ""distance learning"", a way to ""attend"" school from the confines of ones own home. ",4,2,108

D1748C4CD7B4,"Conclusion.Every year, thousands of students are forced to stay home for extended periods of time due to physical or mental illness or other individual reasons. These students, while they are oftentimes provided worksheets and assignments, are quite prone to falling behind in terms of the material. If they are not at school and at the lessons each and every day, it is extremely easy to lose awareness of the material being taught, especially if the only outlet for their learning is a packet of worksheets with practice problems. Without a teacher and peers, these students do not have access to immediate feedback on mistakes or teachers who are able to answer their questions. However, with distance learning, long-term home boundÂ students would be able to work alongside their peers. They could engage in online activities and applications that would strengthen their knowledge of the material, while also allowing them to interact with their teacher and peers. Especially when it comes to video conferencing, students who cannot physically attend school would still be able to ask their teacher questions in person and potentially have private lessons. It is never a student's fault if they are unable to come to school due to an illness; therefore, it should not be difficult to learn if that is the case. ",3,2,217
D1748C4CD7B4,"Conclusion.However, there are steps that can be taken to limit off-task student activity: students could be limited to certain applications or browser extensions or be monitored by a parent or guardian ",6,2,32
D1748C4CD7B4,"Concluding Statement.Distance learning should be made available to all applicable students because it allows for long-term home boundÂ students to attend classes, short-term absent students to make up their school work faster, and increases the student-technology relationship. Distance learning programs would not only help the students in keeping up with their studies, but also teachers in supplying their students with adequate learning resources for all situations. It has become even more prevalent now; as the COVID-19 virus spreads internationally, more and more schools and universities are transitioning to virtual learning for the safety of students, teachers, and staff. Truly, distance learning ensures the safety of those involved without sacrificing any of the benefits of a physical classroom. So long as advancements like distance learning continue to be made in the future, education will maintain its vital and prevalent role in all students' lives. ",1,2,144

D751FAE92161,"Conclusion.Now this statement may seem contradictory at first. ""How would having to go through more words, people, and ideas help me to get to a clearer understanding of my situation? Wouldn't that just cloud up everything?"" you ask. Well, actually, it does the complete opposite! If you only have one opinion, there's less of a chance that you will find the right answer. It's good to narrow down your points once everything you need is presented, but when you have little to almost nothing to go off of in the first place, it's less likely that your choice will be properly informed. Another reason that you may have trouble only going off of one person, is that somebodies advice could be very biased, which could cloud your mindset from the get go. When someone's advice is based only off of their opinion of the person or thing and not your situation or well being, it can be confusing at best, and directly harmful at worst. Finally, there are plenty more options you can choose from as well. This can make it easier to get the exact answer you need. Think about it like looking for an exact brand of paper you need for work . You may not find it at the first store you go to, you might have to drive around town to find it.

Now the only classes available online are the ones that just pump your head full of words and facts. Nearly all schools also have extracurricular sports.

Then the next day you think of all the bad outcomes that can happen all because of the money you decided to takeÂ secretly, what you could have done to make a better choice was to ask multiple people or at leastÂ someone else. Because that way the person could have told you to ask the cashier at the store if they knew someone reported that they lost their money or to just leave it their and maybe the owner of the money could comeback and take back their money. But that still can leave you with a feeling of regret, so what you can do next time is ask someone to give you advice before making an action so you don't end up with a feeling of regret. ",3,2,168

DBC53691CD0A,"Conclusion.When students attend school, they have to communicate with other students and teachers. Therefore, students learn how to correctly interact with others, and build good relationships. However if a student is taking classes online, they wouldn't be obligated to actually communicate with peers in person. Having the ability to talk to others is a very important skill for their working careers in the future. During a career you will be forced to interact with many people such as, co-workers, costumers, and clients. Therefore, attending school is a great way to obtain those skills by talking to other students and their teachers. Furthermore, It is also a great way to build friendships with kids their age. Having friends can change the overall experience to a childhood because it can lead to a life necessity called ""fun"". Life wouldn't be the same if I didn't have people that I could call my friend because learning can be more interesting if you're experiencing it with people you know and trust. Lastly when a student can build relationships with their teachers, not only does it give you an easier learning environment, but it also provides an adult that you can ask questions or talk to. I have good relationships with many of my teachers, therefore allowing me to have a great experience in school. I am able to go to them if I ever need something or if I'm confused about a certain topic. Relationships with teachers can also ""make or break"" your experiences in your classes. When you look up to your teacher, it's more likely for you to want to learn what they are teaching because you have respect for them. Overall, having social interaction skills is very important for a good learning experience, and for everyday life in the future. ",3,2,300

DBCC1F8F92B5,"Conclusion.In sixth grade, I was student council president of my school, and one of the topics many students wanted me to address was on bullying. I didn't know how exactly I could help students going through this horrible ordeal, because many victims of bullying don't like to stand up for fear of more shame. When I consulted with teachers, students, and my parents, they all had an overarching idea of focusing on kindness and the prevention of bullying, instead of bullying itself. This was something I never thought of before and never would have been able to think of, but with the aid of many others, I was able to form a new idea for approaching bullying in my school. I established a wristband kindness program, where wristbands were given out to students who were seen doing kind acts, such as helping another student without being asked or holding the door open at recess. When those students saw another student doing a thoughtful deed, they would pass on the bracelet and continue the spread of kindness. This motivated many young children to become more generous and understanding, a trait that will take them far in life. This idea wouldn't have even have been possible if it weren't for all the kids and teachers that helped me decide what I should focus on as student council president, as well as giving me the ideas for the project. I was able to develop a more inclusive program from multiple opinions, which also helps provide different viewpoints in conflicts. ",3,2,257

If you ever have someone who can't give you an answer easily, the best choice is to ask someone else. They may have the abilities to give you a well thought outÂ answer.

DE2A70D1284E,"Concluding Statement.As a result of us collectively having different experiences in life, we get to provide one another with new thoughts and ideas through giving advice. The process of seeking multiple opinions can provide you with a guaranteed and better outcome for handling a pressing conflict. You can also recognize the many ways one can look at the situation. As well as, recognize the results from of others when they went through the same occurrence, and the multiple ways you can resolve the situation. Having a myopic mind can be a true curse, and taking advice from others prohibits yourself from making consequential mistakes because of being blinded by bias. Talking to others who have dealt with the similar problem allows you to feel more comfortable in your situation, and gain some peace in being to relate to another. Having others provide with different ways they would resolve the situation allows you to consider the many options and pick the best one for your situation.

E24F801F1C4A,"Conclusion.If you ask for help, you might not have so much stress, therefore you might make the decision faster.

When something goes by faster you can just think about the furture and not worry so much on the present. You can make other decisions too, do fun stuff with friends, instead of thinking and worrying about one thing. School might be less stressful because you will not be carring so much weight on your shoulders and you will focus more. Everyone already knows school is so stressful, so making one little thing less stressful can help you focus a lot more.

E9179F8981D6,"Conclusion.Such skills include presenting, leading, critical thinking, and even working with other students. With online courses and video conferences, there is a severe lack in the listed factors. Most assignments consist of projects, virtual laboratory experiments, research and technical papers, and, of course, tests. This is all mainly individual work, with no collaboration between other students. Making that shift from individual work to team work is not easy, and working with others is a common task in many fields, like engineering and medicine, that students will have to face in their future careers. Working in groups comes with leadership, an important attribute that students will need when they are tasked with managing a project or even running a company in their future career. In addition to collaboration and leading, presentations is another factor that distance learning fails to include. If a student, for instance, wants to obtain a business major in college, they will need to be able to present their ideas effectively and efficiently, a skill that is necessary in not just business, but in all career pathways. Although the listed skills are all important, they can ultimately be attained. One's ability to critically think, however, is not gained through viewing a slideshow posted by a teacher or video conferencing with an instructor; it gained through experience - experience you can not get at home with distance learning. All of these skills are necessary in one's future career, and without such skills or exposure to them, students will face many obstacles that public and private school would otherwise adequately prepare them for.

E9179F8981D6,"Conclusion.These students, especially if they are video conferencing, have the opportunity to learn one-on-one with a teacher who can address their individual needs. ",3,0,24
E949DAF7C54B,"Conclusion.It could be that they want to see what other's would do in a certain situation or, just want help and they know that whoever they are asking has been in the same situation before and know how to help or have a suggestion for you to try out. And most people rely on second opinion's because they rule out any other options. For example, if you are debating on buying something that you want, you look at the rating's to see if other people liked it. This counts as an opinion. Or you look at the comment's section to see if it's actually what you want and if people think it's worth it. Getting a second opinion helps in everyday life. People are alway's asking for second opinion's without even realizing it. You do it all the time by asking if your hair looks good or, if they like what your wearing today. It's just a mindless thing we do. We even do it in our head we think about what people would say and we ask them what they think. It's just something everyone does all the time because it's a self conscious thing we all do. ",3,2,200

E974D272C14E,"Concluding Statement.Overall, online learning would be ill-fitting for my generation and others to come because it destroys creativity, does not help one in the real world, and would be difficult for teenagers due to their lack of motivation.

EBBA36F7459C,"Conclusion.Saddened, I starred at my grade for Algebra 1 Honors. That year I had gotten a B average throughout all 4 quarters. That night I spent hours pondering over the different mathematics courses I could take the next year. I could either retake Algebra 1 Honors, or move up to Geometry honors. Despite the time I took weighing the two options, I was unable to reach a decision and I decided to consult with my family and friends. When I asked my friends, many of them had different reasons and exposed me to several outlooks. My mom and dad were also split down the middle. My mom believed that I should retake the course to improve my grade point average for high school, while my dad argued that the the one low grade wouldn't effect me that much because there are many other courses in high school. Finally, I asked my uncle, a wise and intelligent man, what he believed was the proper course of action. Talking with my uncle helped me figure out the right decision which was to move on to Geometry Honors ",4,2,186
EBBA36F7459C,"Conclusion.can allow anyone to see separate outlooks on situations, ",0,2,10
EBBA36F7459C,"Conclusion.For example, if someone talked to just their group of friends, their friends may say things with the sole purpose of pleasing them, leading them to an unbalanced view. On the contrary, if someone talked to a group of people who didn't have their best interests at heart, it would also lead to an unbalanced view on the situation. For example, when I was talking to my peers about retaking Algebra 1 honors, those who had decided to move to Geometry Honors all told me that I should also move on. However, those who had decided to retake Algebra and those who were taking Algebra for the first time all told me to retake Algebra. When I asked why the later group why they wanted me to retake, most of them said that it was just so I could be in their classes. However, hearing the opinions from the former group of friends helped me see the bias, and thus effected my final decision. ",3,2,165
ED8C3FA6FC82,"Conclusion.A lot of people are going to say a lot of different things about your situation. This gives you more options to make a better choice in the end. The more options you have, the more possibilities there are and then choose the one you think is best. It also gives you the opportunity to use the process of elimination for options you don't consider to be helpful. This can help for any situation you may be in. ",3,2,79

EDACE717C302,"Conclusion.Online learning accommodates students with disabilities as well as students with injuries that may prevent them from easily leaving their homes. It is unfair that our education system would require that they come to school when they can learn the same, or potentially more information from home. Recently, it has become clear that online learning is feasible for an entire school. Take for example, schools in Italy or South Korea. These countries have temporarily closed their schools until April in order to better combat the novel corona virus, COVID-19. That said, the schools are still holding lessons online where attendance is taken and students are given the same education by the same teachers, only through a computer screen. If it is feasible for other nations to accommodate for their students during a health epidemic then surely we can also implement a similar program for our students during times of peace. Furthermore, we can not, both morally and legally, allow for our disabled students to receive a sub parÂ education than their peers. That is a disservice not only to them but the moral foundation and integrity of the community as a whole. Similarly, students with mental illnesses like depression or anxiety are more likely to be productive and learn in an online setting than they are in the classroom ",3,2,220
EDACE717C302,Conclusion.Many students take classes pertaining to IT and computer science online in order to gain a complex understanding of these fields and go on to major in these related fields. ,3,0,31
EDACE717C302,"Conclusion.It should not be an expectation for students who simply wish to pursue their interests to enter an extremely competitive and difficult environment for the same education that they could receive through less traumatic means. Although institutions like Generic_School of Science and Technology boost a student's resume, they are wholly unnecessary for students who just want to take a couple extra classes and maybe receive some extra credits.

F54BD89B665A,"Conclusion.Take for example, completing an online course. When students are at home taking the online course, they are placed in a more comfortable environment that lacks a working ambiance. Consequently, there is a greater chance that the student could focus their attention away from the work because of distractions that may include: television, chores, video games, and others. They may also more easily have the tendency to slack off and fall behind. While completing work at a school, students are surrounded by materials that place them in the mindset of their education, and provided help and support that encourages learning and success, rather than the at home comforts. Fortunately, at school there are a limited number of things that will focus ones attention away from what is needed to be completed, and done to the fullest potential with effort. In a working environment the encouragement to learn not only comes from the instructors, but also the other students that also attend the school. ",3,2,164

FAA638E881EB,Conclusion.it is helpful because it will make you see your problem in a different way. It gives you reasons why you should do something and why you shouldn't something. It gives the person who is asking for advice two options. Let's say you broke your moms TV remote and you don't know how to tell your her so you ask a friend what would they do if they were you. Your friend gives you their feedback and you still aren't sure if that was good advice so you ask some other friends and they tell you what they think you should do and you come to your answer.

FEF42864AE28,"Conclusion.A significant problem in schools today, is students getting behind the pace of the class and having to rush in order to catch up. This leads to them not fully grasping the full understanding of what's being taught. Students will also tend to produce sloppier work when rushing and getting a worse grade than they could have. Home school however, does not have this problem as students can go at their own pace whether its fast or slow. This helps students get the grades they deserve instead of rushing and having them not produce their best effort. Having home schooled students work at their own pace also creates beneficial work habits due to them actually doing the full amount of work. If students are not completing the required amount of work or more, than they may start to think that it's appropriateÂ to only give half of their best effort instead of putting the full amount of work in for an assignment.
