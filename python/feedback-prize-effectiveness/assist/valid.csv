007ACE74B050,"Conclusion.Hi, i'm Isaac, i'm going to be writing about how this face on Mars is a natural landform or if there is life on Mars that made it. The story is about how NASA took a picture of Mars and a face was seen on the planet. NASA doesn't know if the landform was created by life on Mars, or if it is just a natural landform. ",4,0,68

00944C693682,"Conclusion.""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (Source 1). This alone should be enough to horrify anyone out of such copious amounts of car usage. If that were not enough, ""transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions"" (Source 4). It is clear that cars are only doing more harm to this earth all humans live on and happen to only have one of, so there is no need to continue on knowing this without changing something about that. Even car-pooling could significantly reduce emissions as there would be less cars out there, which is possible through ""more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work"" (Source 4). 
",3,2,135
00944C693682,"Concluding Statement.Individual car use isn't bad. Millions of individuals using cars, however, is very bad. Note the emphasis. Even just making a concious effort to car pool, bike to work or school, use public transportation, or use some sort of alternative transportation could be enough to clear up the air of some of it's emissions, keep oneself and others happier and less stressed, save time and money, and improve their city all in one little decision. It's just a matter of going ahead and doing it, so what is stopping anyone from going out and making that change now? Be the change you want to see and limit your car usage now.  ",1,2,113

04147BBED91A,"Conclusion.Students may also use this feature in art classes to really capture what the artist was depicting in the work. For instance, this new software was able to create percentages of Mona Lisa's emotions. The latest innovation in computer software may be very useful for art classes, knowing how a person may be feeling in a painting may help students to depict the artists work, a bit better. As humans, we can tell how someone may be feeling by the look on their face, or the look in their eyes. Most of us would have trouble trying to describe what facial expressions convey being happy, besides a smile. The computer can make exact percentages on each emotion you may be feeling. ",3,2,122

07D3CBDEFCEF,"Conclusion.Their job is to connect and work with students. When introducing a computer system, students may realize they are just another task to be completed in the work place. Every year, students are analyzed to see where they place on the national benchmark for their education, they take standardized tests to see how much they know, they do hearing tests and eye tests, but a computer has yet to analyze them to see how happy they might be. If computers are introduced to read emotions, students may feel like they are just a number or rank of emotions. If students go to their counselors, they want to be talked to and connected with. Bringing in a computer can divide the connection from child to adult. The child may feel alienated and refuse to converse with the adult. This computer may seem like a helpful tool, but it destroys the importance of human connection. ",3,2,154

09D40BD05847,"Conclusion.So if im angry im most likely will have a negative vibe and if you put something up that is close to be negative its not going to make me happy. If I am in a good mood more than likely I would not want to see no Ad. Then there expression is compared against a neutral face, some people just look naturally mad.

In addition, your minds need to focus on one thing while driving and that is the road. Simultaneously, the usage of your phone while driving makes your unaware of the happenings that may occur on the road. Current health teens a recent magazine advises when you aren't on the road there's a great danger of missing something pay attention listen because it only takes a matter of time before you get in a wreck.

0BB223A348F6,Conclusion.let them express their creativity. ,0,2,6
0BB223A348F6,"Conclusion.A student that loves cars will try more on a project they designed about cars then a teacher telling them to design a project about Anatomy. Also, if a student knows a lot about a specific topic then it would be easier to write about it compared to a topic they have almost no knowledge of. For example, if I know almost everything that has to do with Poker then I would rather write about that instead of computers which I know nothing about. During the summer, many students will be on vacation with their families. The summer is the one time students get a long relaxing break and are free from work. Summer projects assigned by teachers can be stressful and confusing at times which is why it should be a student-designed project. Students designing their own project would allow them to work on it at their own time and do it at a comfortable pace. Creativity is an important skill which students should be allowed to express.

0BDD43321AFD,"Conclusion.sometimes the projects can interfere with summer plans, making it troublesome to get work done. ",0,0,16
0BDD43321AFD,"Conclusion.Student-designed projects could focus on what students question or wonder about in their day to day lives, peaking their interests and making the task feel more fun and creative. Students could receive a broad outline like 'write an essay' or 'create a display', and turn it into a unique piece that expresses themselves; something like a paper on endangered animals. ",0,2,61
0BDD43321AFD,"Conclusion.During summer a lot of trips and vacations are taken whether with family or friends, near or far. Nevertheless, each one requires people to leave their homes and travel with the minimal amount necessary to save space. In my experience, I once was gone for almost the entire summer. One week I was in Pennsylvania with my relatives and the next I was swimming in the crystal clear waters of the Bahamas. Now imagine if these vacations, no matter how long the duration, were to be taken away from students because of a teacher-designed, summer project. If one was to receiveÂ a project of this type, there is no way of telling how much time or the location required to get it done. For example, if teachers were to design a summer research paper on the history of where you live, it might be necessary to go to the public library to view history records. No one can do that or go there if they're skiing all the way in Colorado. ",3,2,172
0BF9F64D6FD1,"Conclusion.Students across all age groups look forward to the last day of school, the day summer vacation begins. From the endless memories summer entails, to the exciting, fun experiences, summer vacation is one of the most beneficial times for students. For many high school students, teachers assign summer assignments or projects that relate to a class they may be taking in the upcoming school year. These assignments tend to require an expansive amount of time and also tend to be rather ineffective. In the summer students want to fill their time with exciting activities that they would enjoy.

Parents, teachers, students, and principals have felt the need to express their opinion on the implementation of extracurricular activities.

Some choose to attend and others choose to abstain. I partake in them occasionally, but I tend to go home once the final bell rings. That was before my principal decided that all

Generic_School students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, whether it be sports, yearbook design, student council, or something else.

10D09AB4D6C7,"Conclusion.To understand how fatigued they are, allow me to use an example of someone who is exhausted without the addition of extracurricular activities to their schedule: me. I wake up at 5:50, board my school bus at 6:30, attend school from 7:30 to 2:15, get home at 3:00, and do homework for four hours before eating dinner and going to sleep. Add three hours to the mix and I am going to bed at 11:00, giving me only six hours to sleep. Not seven, not eight, not nine, and certainly not ten. Following a routine where there is only time for six hours of sleep decreases concentration, slows thinking, damages memory, and can even stunt growth during puberty. Generic_School students cannot simply adapt to the new conditions. No middle school student can.

1313ADFE62C6,"Conclusion.Â At first when you decide to participate activities such as school clubs, you may be hesitant because you don't know if you will enjoy what you're going to do there, but your ideas might change after spending time there. If there was a rule saying that students did have to participate in an extracurricular activity, some students might feel as though they are being forced and won't enjoy their time participating in it. However, a lot of students' viewpoints may change over time and they grow to love the activity that they're doing. These kinds of activities can help students discover more about how they like spending their time. A poll performed on Harvard University students showed that 84% of students didn't know what they wanted to major in before joining an extracurricular activity in either middle school or high school. A similar experiment performed by Generic_School showed that, when the principal decided all students must participate in an extracurricular activity, 92% of students enjoyed the activity that they participated in throughout the school year. It also showed that 65% of those students decided to continue that extracurricular activity the following year because they liked doing it. Schools offer many different kinds of activities to participate in, and they can help you discover both your passions and hobbies. When you discover what your passionate about in a certain activity, it also gives you the opportunity to socialize with peers participating in the same activity that might be interested in the same things you are.

14A542270754,"Conclusion.The point is that you take a long break to refresh you for the next year so you don't burnout (e. g. senioritis). Furthermore, most people figure out how to keep up with the workload by the end of the following year anyways. And, even if students make it slightly easier, it is still reflective the curriculum - and in the long run it's that knowledge that matters, especially later in life. Likewise, if students can put it off for a month or so, that isn't really a bad thing. Spacing, or leaving what learning and then coming back to it right when you're almost forgetting it, is one of the most scientifically backed learning techniques we know of. In one study, students were asked to memorize words in Spanish, but split into multiple groups. As compared to the control of 8 hours of straight studying, the group that studied four hours, then four hours an entire month later, did over twice as well on a test of that vocabulary after the study.

151F9011BF04,"Conclusion.Venus, otherwise known as the ""Evening Star,"" is one of the more challenging planets to examine closely in our solar system. While this plant is often called Earth's twin, it is vastly different in terms of environment and hospitability.

The danger of Venus is extensive due to the high temperatures, extreme atmospheric pressure, and wild weather patterns. These obstacles are being dealt with though by new ideas from scientists at NASA. One big idea from NASA is the idea to use a blimp to observe Venus from above the surface. Another idea of theirs is to use materials that would be able to withstand the extreme conditions of the Venusian environment. All this is in the hopes that futher insight will be made on the planet that once was the most Earth-like planet in the solar system. ",1,2,140

1CF149052D11,"Conclusion.If the enforcer of this project wrote a rigid outline describing exactly what a learner must write about, the report could very plausibly be submitted as a mindless paper with no true interest taken in it.

There wouldnt be a way of giving this mediocre paper the grade it deserves, because the student did what they were told and they took advantage of that loophole. To avoid this mindless compliance, students should instead be given total and complete freedom on their report as long as they apply everything they've learned throughout the school year. This would be a double edged sword, while they are free to design however they want, they must also put in more effort because they will not get any help or instruction from the teacher. Some may believe that a teacher-designed project is a better alternative because if the teacher has a specific rubric, they can help the student by giving them a code to follow ",3,2,177

1E8C298D92CB,"Conclusion.by making the internet a better way to communicate, having funner ways to transport yourself, and making it easier to access stores. Getting in a car to go to a freinds house is in most cases is a long stressful process that can be eliminated through a culture without cars that opens up Internet use to communicate instead. ""She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends"" (Rosenthal paragraph 35). Mimi Sheller is explaining how you don't have to get into a car to be with your friends and that the Internet is a simplier option. Instead of using a car to get to work, it may be a healthier and funner option for people to start walking or riding a bike. "" 'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife"" (Rosenthal paragraph 24). In the quote, Carlos describes how stress is relieved by lower pollution and opening yourself up to activities that you and someone you love could enjoy while getting to work. Stress can be driven by simple things in life such as trying to find a parking spot to access the market. ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway"" (Rosenthal paragraph 6). To have less stress in your life it could be easier to live in a no cqar community that makes any store you need only a walk away from your house leaving you free of the harshness of finding a parking spot. Internet communication, alternate transportation, and walk ways to stores make a happier and healthier life for the average person.

1EFAC87220DC,"Conclusion.In today's society, managers don't hire people based on their high schoolÂ grades, but on their creativity and their great ideas that they could bring to the table. If you want to become a manager of a company or even an entrepreneur, you must have great ideas. You must also be able to use your own creativity to persuade people to join your company or buy your products. Your teacher isn't going to just come up with your ideas when you get older, so why should they now. The younger you are at learning how to come up with your own ideas and how to be more creative, the more you're going to flourish as you get older.

200AA7A37060,"Conclusion.While many teachers say no child left behind that is often not the case with summer projects. Because these projects are assigned before the teacher gets the chance to really know the students a it is difficult to adjust to a students specific needs. A teacher may assign project with lots of heavy reading not knowing that a few of her students are dyslexic, or a different teacher may assign something on a topic many of the students are already well versed in so it has little value to repeat it. Student designed projects would avoid these conflicts as the students know themselves best and could be able to tailor their project to their strengths. Many English classes have already found success in doing this where instead of assigning books that students may have already read or are difficult for some to read, these classes allow students to study books of their choice or listen to audio books. Student designedÂ projects are often more applicable to students lives and as a result they are a better form of education and learning than teacher designed projects. ",3,2,186

20162733792B,"Conclusion.In the text the author states how the technology performs the task of reading emotional appeals. For example, in paragraph 3 line 1 the author says,""The process begins when the com puter constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit"". So apparently this process goes beyond just looking at the face,but actually looking for the movements in facial muscles. The author also talks about the muscles that present certain emotions such as the ; the muscles above your eyes (frontalis oars lateralis) raise when you're surprised,the muscles around your mouth (orbicularis oris) tightens your lips when you're angry, and more. This shows that the computer breaks facial expressions down to a science. ",3,0,139

20D57DEC3EF5,"Conclusion.Why? becuase some people want to express themselves of their feelings that has been done by others. But not such that. In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everday. For instance you can probably tell if a friend is feeling simply emotion by looking at thair face. But for some people painting portraits can help them express their feelings through painting. Sometimes people express their emotions through music by singing or making music. Then in the Mona Lisa, no one knows what feeling she is expressing and what is she feeling. For instance, some artists say she is happy but no one really knows what emotion she is feeling ",3,1,112
20D57DEC3EF5,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion, I think classrooms shouldn't use Facial Action Coding System to identify the expression of students an how they are feeling. But some people have hidden talents that they use to express themselves or their emotions. Also not many people icluding students express themselves through painting some use dancing, acting, making music, singing, cooking and their are many ways of expressing your emotions through many things. For instance people express themselves through writing books, but many people can understand their feelings that by reading their life as a book. ",1,1,92

The more the project is worked on, the more complex and thorough it will be. Interest and excitement in a topic positively affect the extent to which the project will be worked on. Typically, the time spent on the project is directly related to the overall understanding of the concept. Considering teachers assign summer work to assure students continue learning during their break, projects should be student-designed as they promote a deeper understanding of the given topic.

279E6B94B3C4,"Conclusion.Phones are big distractions in the world today, especially in teens who just start driving, when they get a message the first thing they know to do is check it no matter what. To fix this problem states have inflicted heavier laws, for example Georgia has the no hands law and that means you can't have any hands on your phone at all, not even calls can be answered. Texting while driving is such a bad choice because it can cause you to swerve off road or swerve into someone's car. It's a bad habit in today's society and it needs to be stopped. ",3,0,105
27E6536433B9,"Conclusion.These disabilities cause some kids to have trouble with school work, focusing, and completing simple tasks such as writing with a pencil. This is why it would not be beneficial to force these kids to do extracurricular activities. The rigorous work of clubs like a math club, a yearbook club, or a reading club would overstimulate some of these kids. It would lead to tantrums, fits, and bad behavior from some of these kids, and it would distract the other club members from their work. Extracurricular activities like baseball or football would not be beneficial for them either because some of these kids with disabilities have trouble throwing a ball, standing up straight, and walking if it is a serious case. While it is not a bad thing for kids with disabilities or mental disabilities to join a club or sport, it is just harder for some of them to do extracurricularÂ activities because of their underlying issues.

28E2327785FC,"Conclusion.In today's day and age, we are privileged to have the ability to drive vehicles anywhere that we please. The use of technology gave us the responsibility of driving. With that being said the responsibility of driving is very important because you're not only putting your life at risk, but also other drivers on the road. There can be many distractions while you are driving which can cause you to wreck and be seriously injured from it. One of the biggest distractions in today's age is the use of cellphones. With the improvements made to technology, you can use cellphones anywhere on the road, which causes it to be the number one distraction. ",4,2,114
28E2327785FC,"Conclusion.According to the National Safety Council they reported that ""cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year"". They also reported that ""nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. With those outrageously high statistics, I strongly agree with the idea of doing away with cellphones while driving. Also, 94 percent of drivers support a ban on texting while driving and 74 percent support a ban on hand held cell phone use. Having that high of a support percentage shows that are many other people who feel the same as I do. It is a very dangerous problem that is going on in todays day. With myself being a high school student and driver, I can first hand tell you this is a major proem with teens. I see many of my friends and also other students of my school using their cellphones while there driving and putting themselves in dangerous situations. ",3,2,163
28E2327785FC,"Conclusion.As the majority of people know the using your phone is very dangerous and also distracting. However, with the teen's situations there are 16-year old's and older who are not that experienced with driving but are also more easily distracted then adults ",0,0,43
28E2327785FC,"Concluding Statement.There are plenty of other distractions that go on when driving a motorized vehicle, but the use of phones is most caused. These deaths and accidents from distracted driving with your phones can be very managed. If people were to follow the law of not using them in the car and to be more careful then these outrages percentages will become more and more less. Also, I would like to express the fact that there are many options in vehicles that allow you to use your devices via Bluetooth and voice control. So, if there was an emergency you can answer and talk on the phone without even having to pick up your phone and looking away. This concludes my essay I strongly believe in not using your devices while driving and I hope to have expressed the effect is has. ",1,2,143

2B4BE109A9D7,"Conclusion.Many cause of limited car usage tends to have less people on the streets. Near the French and Swiss borders ; streets and driveways and home garages were not allowed for free parking. It forced people to park in places where it was usually crowded. Most people did not like the parking rules. They either rode their bikes or walked back and forth to get to their destination. Later after that, many people were very upset with the parking rules, that alot of them decided to sell their car so they could park wherever and that had opened spaces for multiple cars to transpass the roads at the same time.

Same thing in Bogota, Columbia but the problem they had, was the pollution in the air. Columbians rode on buses with other people because the believed it was safer than being in a car and getting in an accident. Paris had the same problem, except they were fined to be driving. About 4,000 drivers were fined and others cars were to be impounded for arguing about being fined.

2B682084579E,"Conclusion.Some opposed to this may say, ""I do not want to do a summer project anyways, therefore let me choose the topic"". I agree that the topic of the project may be more interesting if it is student-designed, ",2,2,39
2B682084579E,"Conclusion.but if the project is teacher-designed you will learn more. Student designed-projects will not test the brain as much as a project that they know nothing about will. Moreover, students will be put to the test more if they have to research something that is beyond logic. Even though you will learn more doing a teacher-designed project it still the easier option. For that reason, teacher-designed projects are the better fit because the whole point of making students do a summer break project is to ensure that they learn as much as possible.

2B682084579E,"Concluding Statement.although student-designed projects are helpful the teacher should be the one innovating these summer projects. Teacher-designed projects accomplish both being the least stressful and being the least tedious. In that light, they should undoubtedly be the way summer break projects are conducted. This summer break if students have to do projects it should be a teacher-designed project, not only for the benefit of the students but the teacher will also be able to grade the projects easier because all of the projects should be similar.

There have been countless times when students would stand outside waiting to be picked up from an after school activity. The students would stand outside for a long period of time. Standing outside without adult supervision can be dangerous for a student.

2DA25C61D18D,"Conclusion.For example, two years ago, my former World History teacher, Mr Generic_Name, had us do a project over the summer about the most important events in world history. Fortunately, he gave the opportunity to choose our own format for the project. Luckily for my friend Generic_Name, he decided to complete the project in the form of a song, considering he was very musically talented. Over the summer he would plan when to work on it that best fit his schedule so he wouldn't be stressed to finish the song. He researched about the effects of World War II and finished his song in no time. He stated that it was one of the best projects he had ever completed because for the first time, he felt like he actually learned something while doing an activity that he loved and had fun with. This clearly shows the effects of giving students a choice in designing their own projects for the best learning experience. ",3,2,163

She loudly complained about how boring the project was and how it was extremely time consuming. She even stated she got nothing out of it. Because she didn't have fun, she didn't learn anything and was furious by this outcome. This undoubtedly shows that teacher designed projects make students feel like they don't learn anything and overall, make them feel bitter about the subject. ",3,2,125

The landform would be shaped as a circle, square or any other simple shape, and it would not be so ridgid and cracked. If you were to look at the photo furthest to the left, you would assume that it resembled a face, but If you compair that photo to the one taken twenty-five years later, you would begin to understand that to photo was out-dated and that the camera was not as clear as the one taken later.

2E57A0350FFD,"Conclusion.I love being able to go out on the sea and have fun will helpping people with there problems make me super happy and I wouldn't have this job if my friend didn't tell me about it. For example (the world war11) I got to go to many places like China, Europe, and Italy.

I was happy to help all this people with there problems and when we got to go on a ship, we had the opportunity to take turns to watch over the animals at night to feed them and to make sure that nothing bad is happening like fighting our the bottom of the ship is being filled up with water.

So I signed up to watch them and so I got the job. I had to stay up super late to watch them and to I went to tell the captin that every thing was okay and so on my way I slipped on some water and I fell.

I had almost fell overboared but I didn't, thanks to a peice of meatel on the side of the boat and i was happy that I didnt die. I am thankful that I am still alive after breaking my ribs, and slidding down a latter. I soon recovered and was back to the job and so we took all the animals back to were they were.

So we made a game place were they were. We played a whole bunch of games and we did are ruiten, until we had another jod were we had to go get animals and watch over them. I am thankful to be able to do this job with people who care about me and support me well this job.

I wonder what are next job will be? Will I break another bone in my body? Can I survie another animal watch? Will I survie breaking another bone in my body? I don't know if i can survie another bone in my boby that can be broken?

After about a month we get a call to go get some animals and so we went to go get them and I have to say it was a long ride to go to Teaxs and it was close to were my uncle lived and so we got there and there was a huge sand storm and so we had to go get alll the horses, and take them to the sea and then I relized that my uncle had this one horse and it did not like me at all. As we were getting the horses around I seen that horse. The captin asked me if I wanted to watch the animals that week and I said "", Yes I will'. So I was up all night watching all the horses and so I had to feed them. I was feed the one horse that hated me the most and it kicked me right in the neck as I was feeding him. I was out for a really long time and my best friend came down there and found me on the floor ""sleeping"". ",3,1,521

3005ADCF9F86,Conclusion.The teacher would use it to see how they where feeling and with one other thing if a student is texting under his lap or something is smiling or showing some type of motion a teacher could have the machine read what they are feeling about during that time to even hundred percent know kids where on there phones that could be a good thing for teachers but bad for students and that would make students even more mad or anything towards school or teachers ,3,0,86

The other 30% that do, do not have a place to park them, making them basically useless. Residents in Vauban have stopped their need for transportation, making malls and stores a walk away.

The rock maybe have laded and make or had a face shape from the way it landed. Im not so sure if it had landed like that to make a face shape. That's what I am thinking, is that it was like that from the way it had moved or it had changed. Some pople are surprised that they haved found a human face in the or in a planet. I know its kinda wierd but u never know what could happen.

They say it had a human face. They say it had eyes and it had a nose and it had a mouth in the face. They should be scared because what if it was aliens that did that and that made the face.

32A121824D02,"Conclusion.The reason why no spacecraft has touched down on planet Venus is because of the clouds itself.

On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmoshpheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" Venus has a temperature of 800 degrees fahrenheit, while Earth's highest temperature is at least 110 to 120 degrees. So planet Venus is very hot, that probably explains why no spacecraft can land on the planet because it's so hot in the planet that the clouds trap all that heat inside.

It's not worth paying a large ticket to send a short text message. Additionally, if someone dies in a car crash because of your actions, such as texting and driving, you could be charged with vehicular manslaughter and go to jail for up to 20 years. Texting and driving tickets, if shown on a police report for a wreck you are responsible for, will greatly increase your insurance rates, making your life a lot harder than it was before you decided to text and drive.

340734FCEDC4,"Conclusion.Not all students will feel the same, though, which is also where this technology could come in. At the beginning of a school year, perhaps, the teacher could use the technology on the class to see how they feel about the particular subject. Then, the students who are excited about the subject and show interest could be sorted into a class that can be run in a way that makes the class educationally suitable for students who actually want to learn that subject. The students that do not show as much interest, or none at all, could be sorted into a seperate class that makes the subject more fun, but still teaches the same points as the other class. ",3,2,120

340734FCEDC4,"Conclusion.If many students start to become bored, then the teacher could come up with a quick game to enrich the learning experience. If many of the students are already interested with the subject matter, the teacher may not have to do as much adjusting. If the students need to be enriched with games and activities, now the teacher will immeditely know. This could overall make learning a lot more fun, but introducing more games and activities into the curriculum as see fit. If the students want to play knowledge enriching games, they can just show disinterest, and the system would pick that up and inform the teacher. The technology to read student's emotions in the classroom as a very basic level could make learning more fun and personal to the student. ",3,2,132

This quote makes it clear to the audience that scientists are doing whatever it takes to develop multiple, efficient plans for space travel. The author also goes onto provide different examples to further convey how close scientists are to developing the safest plan possible. They specifically mention the use of simplified electronics made of silicon carbide and explain how they've already been tested in a chamber that simulate the conditions of Venus's surfaces, yet how they're still being improved upon. They also describe an old technology called mechanical computer, noting how this technology has already been used frequently in the 1940's and how it can be incorporated into space travel now.

3D303A57E7A4,"Conclusion.To elaborate, drama, or theater, involves everyone to communicate with each other to create a scene that will dazzle the audience. They must decide how to react, talk, and act to one another to make the performance truly spectacular.

Additionally, students don't just see their classmates when they go to their chosen activity, there are other kids from other grades there as well, so it's the perfect chance to meet unfamiliar people, and chat with familiar people, too. To add to that, the activity likely brings out skills in others that you didn't know they had, and that enables students to connect with one another and find out more about each other. ",3,2,113
3D303A57E7A4,"Conclusion.For example, teens in charge of the yearbook have a entertaining time making sure their product is pleasing to the eye, so that our school has something valuable to sell to students, and so that they can look back on all the great memories they had at our precious school. Nevertheless, at the same time they're expressing their creativity into the book. Also, the art students create posters and fliers to advertise upcoming school events so that everyone can enjoy that event with their friends. I know by experience that creating colorful, bright papers is a fun-filled activity to do. Plus, some students who are in the Environment Protection Youths of Virginia group volunteer to pick up litter along the sidewalks, in parks, and many other places that would harm the environment of our beloved state if they weren't cleared and cleaned. They have a wonderful time doing just that while chatting to their friends.

",0,0,24
3D3E4F0B74D2,"Conclusion.Venus has value because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself just like intimidating endeavors does as well.

Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts, it should only be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

This helps to strive to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value. ",3,1,63
3D3E4F0B74D2,"Concluding Statement.So, because our travels should not be limited by dangers and doubts, intimidating endeavors should only be expanded to meet the imagination and innovation of the travel.

So, because Venus is simple to see from the distant and because our travels should be expanded, studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it only presents a small amount of dangers.

So, If Venus was more of a dangerous planet to explore, walk on, and study, would this be a planet that everyone would be interested to study and afraid to walk on to explore?  ",1,0,95
3D7B1F039322,"Conclusion.In order to become a teacher, one has to go to college and earn a degree along with a teaching license and certification. Years of studying and mastering the material provides them with the tools needed to teach their students the subject. Students go to school in order to learn. If they do not know the material, how do they have any qualifications to design a project that would make sure that they learned everything required by the school district, state, or country? People go to school in order to become teachers because they want to help their students learn and grow. Not only is it the subject the teachers are teaching to them, but life skills and tools they can use in the future. If all the work that the students did was up to them, they would lack important skills like researching and communication that could help them in internships and the work world. ",3,2,157
3D7B1F039322,"Conclusion.Charts, flip charts, and simulations are all used by most teachers to show information that is important. In the summer, students aren't going to want to do homework regardless but if the project is set up with clear and concise directions, it makes the work seem less daunting otherwise. For example, if a student had planned a project, the project would only make sense to them because they are responsible for planning it out and the steps needed. When that transfers onto paper, other students won't know what is happening in the brain of the student who created it and will be confused. ",3,2,104
3D7B1F039322,"Conclusion.If students were given the opportunity to create their own summer assignment, it would most likely end up being under 5 questions with minimal work needed to be done in order to complete it. This does not help the students in any way, shape, or form. Teenagers look for the quick and easy results that aren't as available as they think in the real world. The point of high school is to prepare you for college. If the work you do in high school is easy and not challenging there is a greater risk for those students to struggle more in college with the huge increase in course work. There are some students who crave the challenge and look for the ability to better themselves. ",3,2,126

3E866ECC376A,"Conclusion.A student would show creativity by choosing the colors they like or making it into something that shows significance to them. This would give the project more depth and meaning rather than a simple teacher-designed assignment. Creativity is important in a student's life because it helps speak what is on their mind and generate from there.

While driving you must be sure that your taking every precaution you can to maintain safety for yourself and others as well. Many people believe that the use of cell phones can be very hazardous, and I strongly agree with that statement for many reasons. Cell phones have caused fatal wrecks that lead to either death or serious injury. For example, ""an article published by Tony Long states that he was almost killed on his motorcycle while trying to avoid being hit by a reckless driver who was on the phone."" ",4,2,110

You are not only endangering yourself but your endangering others on the road, as well as passengers, or even any close-by pedestrians. Driving needs complete attention and focus so ensure the risk of any injuries or deaths because driving is very dangerous. Using a cell phone takes away your focus and attention from driving because now you're trying to multi-task which means you're playing with life or lives. Speaking from experience, cell phones should be banned while driving because they slow your reaction time to anything that may be happening around you.

416154D38103,"Conclusion.New technology is being introduced to mankind almost every second in this world, and now, the latest techonology is a computer program called the Facial Action Coding System which can identify a person's emotions. The question is whether this technology is actually valuable and for what it could be used for. Experts suggest this technology could be used in a classroom to identify the state of mind of a student to adjust the lesson they are trying to comprehend. But, even though this technology may be helpful to teachers trying to keep students active and engrossed in their lessons, the question arises of whether this techonlogy is actually worth the recources or whether what experts think is a great idea is actually an invasion of privacy. ",4,2,127
416154D38103,"Conclusion.The article did state that the techonology could identify when a student is ""confused or bored"" and then ""modify the lesson"" to keep a student engaged. In this way, the technology is useful in the fact that it adapts to the needs of the student. ",3,0,46
416154D38103,"Conclusion.Therefore, although this system is useful in the fact that it can gauge the emotions of the students, it is not much more useful than a teacher who can do the same thing by questioning their students on their preferences and ideas. ",6,2,43
416154D38103,"Conclusion.The article states that the technology associates each emotion with ""characteristic movements of the facial muscles"" and then uses those movements to calculate the spectrum of emotions based on their facial display. But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a ""false smile"", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile. Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education. ",3,2,237
416154D38103,"Concluding Statement.Therefore, installing this system in schools would be a waste of money and recourses, especially when teachers can gauge how their students are learning by simply asking their students in an anonymous survey how they feel about their teaching methods. In this society, technology is used to fix almost everything, but in this case, scientists should quit trying to force technology on behavioral issues and just let humans interact so they can benefit themselves with communication, no computerized middleman needed.

41CC238F5738,"Conclusion.in middle school, there's a lot of homework, even more so in high school. A lesson is usually about an hour and a half long. School ends at 3:30, so they'd get home at 5:00. 5 or 6 is the most common dinner time, and it usually lasts about 30 minutes. That's 5:30. Then, they have to go and try to finish their homework. If they have a lot of it, it can take a long time, and can usually lead to them putting off important stuff, like personal hygiene (GROSS!). They're probably super exhausted from their activity, and just want to take a shower. But nope, they have to do the rest of their homework. Depending on how much they have, they could end up staying up really late. Highschoolers can usually end up staying up until 3 am in the morning doing homework. That makes them more tired and not ready to focus the next day. It could've saved them so much more if they didn't have to do the activity. ",3,2,175

The Dr. Huang relies to work on of psycholoists and Dr. Paul Eckam, the creater of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Dr. Eckman classified six basic emotions suprise, anger, happiness, fear, and sadness. Then he made associated each with charatcteristic movements of the facical muscles.

Dr. Huang smiling broadly "" even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"". Huang using video imagery, new emotion-recognition software tracks these movements in a real face or the painted picture of Mona Lisa.

4A5760917477,"Conclusion.The distinct responsibility of having students learn rests on the very shoulders of teachers throughout nine out of the twelve months that are in a year, so the students should direly be permitted to design how they learn over the three month break that they get. This three month break, summer, to most students, is a time where they can finally let go of all their responsibilities and worries and leave them right in the classroom. Most do not think twice about what they have learned over the past semester, but instead are already steps ahead on planning what events. attractions, and/or vacations they may embark on. Teachers still try to make an effort for learners to still store information they have learned and even try add on to it by assigning projects that are aimed directly for students to complete by the next school year. More often than not, projects are long-term, and that causes the student to be continuously involved with the material and truly grasp the knowledge coming at them. ",4,2,174

Dr. HUANG and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. The MONA LISA demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it showa just how much this computer can do. Imagne a computer that knows when you're happy or sad.

507CBD8E9670,"Conclusion.Venus is often reffered to as Earth's twin because it is the closest planet to be like Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Venus would be hard to expore becuase of the planet's suface reaching up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet of solar system and if we tried to land a rover there the metal would just liquify because of the extreme temperature's. NASA however, still wants to try to study the planet but they would have to hover over Venus because of the extreme conditions on the planet's surface. Even at 30 plus miles in the air in Venus the temperatures can reach up to 170 degrees Fahrenheit. However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere. Rendering standard of photography and videography ineffective. The solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth's level.

More importantly, reasearchers cannot take samples of rock, gas,or anything else, from a distance. Threfore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Many reasearchers are working on innovations that would allow the machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. ",3,1,255

The idea of the over the summer projects is neat, but if they are truly going to work then the students should be in control. Getting a choice and a say so in the matter is what may students long for and want, because they may have never had it before. They get to choose and pursue something they may have always dreamed of and want to chase after. With nothing holding them back except their drive and imaginations, these students will finally have a choice to follow their dreams to something much bigger. ",1,2,163
56193E77BB71,"Conclusion.Every living thing on planet earth has emotions. These emotions have been used since the beginning of time to express the feelings of the people around you. However, these emotions can be decieving. Someone could say they are happy, when really they are angry or upset. This is where the Facial Action Coding System comes into play. The FACS is a software that detects human emotion by tracking muscles in the face. For example, when you are happy, muscles in your face move up, and when you are sad, they move down, FACS tracks this and calculates your emotions. The creators of this software, Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe are the leading experts of developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. There are still some questions surrounding the usefulness of FACS, like what could this software actually be used for? One of the ways FACS may be used is in classrooms. ",4,2,156

565B5C8E9B05,Conclusion.Venus is the closest planet to earth and yet to there has been a spacecraft to survive the landing. Although it could be a little bit tough seems haw venus's atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets and the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere. On venus surface the temperatues average over 800 degrees fahrenheit. With that kind of heat and pressure could even crush a submarine. ,3,1,72

You hang out with people in school because they have the personality that you enjoy to hang out with.

But, people with the your interests will understand you better and you will always have something to talk about.

The people in your group will talk about the same things that you do.

For example, a student wants to join the soccer team, and he doesn't know anyone.

The student can is always able to talk to his teammates about soccer because they are on the same team.

Then eventually, the student will no longer have to only talk about soccer because he has finally fit in to the rest of the kids.

Finally, the kids that have the same interests as you will also be the people that you will talk to the most in or outside of school because you like to talk to them about your sport or group. ",3,2,168

59A14F276C3E,Conclusion.Teacher-designed summer projects prepare students for the course by ensuring that they know important background information that will help them succeed later in the year. ,0,2,26
59A14F276C3E,"Conclusion.When teachers are able to create their own summer projects, they can show students the types of assignments that they will see in class, giving the students ample time to understand and adapt to the teacher's standards. They allow students to not only learn new information, but also new strategies and techniques that will help them succeed during the school year. For example, my friend who attends a neighboring high school had a summer assignment from her AP Language teacher, while I had none. She was able to learn all of the rhetorical techniques her teacher wanted her know, as well as how to approach that level of work, over the summer, leaving her well-prepared for the class when it started. I, however, faced a steep learning curve at the start of the year as I tried to figure out my AP Lang assignments while also trying to keep up with all my other schoolwork. Comparatively, my friend had a much eaiser time than I did because she already knew the neccessary skills, having learned it all over the summer. Therefore, teacher-designed summer projects allow students to see how their classes will operate during the school year and respond accordingly, giving them an easier, more prepared start to the year. ",3,2,211
59A14F276C3E,"Conclusion.For example, AP Studio Art students at my high school are required to create a portfolio over the summer with a set number of pieces about the same idea, but they can use any medium they wish, allowing them to express their individual personality and ability. So, while they have to meet certain requirements, they are free to explore new mediums and techniques, as well as showcase their creativity and character. Additionally, teachers can use summer projects as a type of diagnostic, allowing them to assess a class's abilities. If teachers find that the class has a strong grasp on certain skills, then they may be more inclined to allow more student-driven projects during the year. This would allow students to pursue their own interests later in the year, even if they did not have that opportunity over the summer. Teacher-designed summer projects do allow students to learn about what interests them, as long as certain requirements are met. ",3,2,160

",3,0,46
5A3BABA1AE21,"Conclusion.the reason I said to stay active is because when you are outside you never know what you will find or discover if you are doing a project, or just simply exploring the world or the envoirment you live in. Discovering new things helps you think about nature and physical activity that is happening all around you. If you are doing a specific project, then maybe you should look for certain things outside, or even think about what would be great to add on to your project.

Summer break is a time of rest and relaxation for kids who work hard to during the school year; consequently, it's inevitable that students will forgot information they have learned since they are not typically using their brain power while relaxing. To avoid this problem, summer projects are assigned to keep the minds of the students active and to prepare them for the next school year.

Summer projects are usually assigned by teachers or by the school so they know what and how the student is doing academically over the summer.

With a student designed project, the students get to choose what is important to their education and what they need to remember over the summer. The students would also feel a sense of independece from the mostly teacher-based education they normally get.

6198205BB70E,"Conclusion.Besides in the summer, students spend most of the year under the authority of their teachers. If the project they design is on their own terms, they would have more motivation to actually complete it. Since they are no longer under the school's rule during the summer, students may feel more motivated to do their project instead of being forced to do so during the school year. Students would also have more motivation if their summer projects were student-designed because they would not be expected to meet the expectations of their teacher. If the student designs their summer project to their specific skill set, the student may be more motivated to complete the project because he or she is capable of reaching their own goals. Students would most likely turn in better work because they are not under the stress of their teachers' expectations. Because of this, students would have more motivation if their summer projects were student-designed, ",3,2,159
61A0FEA827E4,"Conclusion.Now for a story. In my entire life ive only had one summer project and it was back in middle school. The goal was to just read a chapter book and then to write about it. That year i had read all 6 of the star wars books from ""Phantom Menace"" to ""The Jedi Return"". But i decided to write about ""Revenge of The Sith"" which is my favorite book/movie from the prequel era. I honeslty didnt know how to start the writing ,as a surpirse to no one I was and still am a pretty weak writer. But eventually I came around to write about Anakins insecuritys and the fact no one was honestly there to help him through his dark time and that it consumed him even making him hurt the ones he loved. Now keep in mind I had finished about a week into summer so I was pretty much free to do what I wanted. That same summer I had traveled to Honduras for 2 and a half months to visit. But as soon as I returned school was satrting and I had completely forgotten about the assignment and to put the icing on the cake It was lost. ",3,1,204
61A0FEA827E4,Concluding Statement.I believe student designed projects would be better for its simplicity and for all the groups involved to get a new experience weather its the manner of grading or designing it.

Independence is a vital life skill that can contribute to success. When teacher allow students to independently create their own projects, they are supplying their students with the key to success. Independently developed projects also force students to be resourceful. Projects without clear cut instructions cause students to seek alternate sources for their projects.

655EC70088AA,"Conclusion.Based on the passage , the government would like a change in the way people drive their cars around. Some people would just get in the car and ride all day and night if they could. So what do the head source of some countries even took the drastic measures of baning driving due to so much smog and health problems in the air. Almost 4,000 drivers would be fined becuase of their actions to the news.

In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of colombians hiked, biked, skated or took the buses to work. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day without carsin this capital of 7 million. Of course the goal was to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation. The turnout was huge, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on bogota. for the first time two other Colombian cities, cali and valledupar, joined the event.

By exposing the students to the style, rigor, and expectations of the class, students will know what they are getting themselves into far better than if they were to read and annotate a book that is relevant for the better half of a month. Students would also give future students the ability to practice their skills if they so choose to do so; preparing future students for the essay styles of rhetorical analysis, document based questions, and free response questions that are synonymous with the AP brand.

6A97E65BBE95,"Conclusion.Venus, somethimes called the ""Evenig Star"" is the closest planet to Earth. this planets have differents such as, the size between their, the speed that they move around the sun, this speed mean tht sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus.

The big question here is, why humans never visited this planets in more l tha three decades. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, no since no spacecraft survived the landing for more that a few hours. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.

A thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets Venus. On the planet's surface temperatures average oner 800 degrees Fathrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Also notable, Venus has the hottest sufrace temperature of any planet of solar system, wheather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, and powerful earthquakes.

The National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) has one particulary idea for sending humans to study Venus, Venus would aviod the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up andout of their way, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit. No easy conditions, but survivable for humans.

However, Venus can provide only limited insinght on ground conditions because most forms on light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. ",3,1,254

6AE4BFE2E5CF,"Conclusion.One of the main focuses of school is to prepare a student for adulthood. While school accomplishes that in many ways, it fails to teach students how to truly act independently, because their lives are always in some way being influenced by adults that hold real power. A student-designed summer project would fill this void of education, however, because it encourages students to make choices for themselves and then to carry through with those choices in order to make them a reality. Placing the responsibility of their own education on a student would encourage them to think critically and organizationally in order to create and then implement a strategy. The limitless possibilities of the project, because the design is given over to the student, would teach them how to narrow down vague concepts into specific plans. Even arranging for certain resources to be supplied, depending on the project, would show the student how to control moving parts - whether that manifests in asking their mother to buy eggs from the grocery store or in biking to the library to check out the necessary reading materials. Students are rarely prepared for the autonomy of college and the time-managing aspects of adulthood, because they're used to their parents or teachers doing things for them ",3,2,213

6BF54A9F8383,Conclusion.Should people use their phones while driving? Well 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. People are so distracted by their phones they forget about their own safety at risk while driving. While you're driving you should be more focused on the road and your surrounds more than a Facebook notification. It's not only teens that do this adults as well use their phones while driving. It is one of the leading reasons of car accidents today. Not only are you putting yourself at risk but you're putting others in risk as well. ,4,2,104
6BF54A9F8383,Concluding Statement.So now should people should you use your phone while driving? Think of what could happen while doing such a thing like checking your phone. It isn't worth it at all to look at that notification at all. You can save yourself from getting into an accident. You can save yourself from potentially killing someone for just looking away for 2 seconds. So please don't use your phone while driving please and thank you. ,1,0,76

6BFE57AA416B,"Conclusion.Rather than just meeting the requirements that the teacher has given them, a student can go above and beyond on a project when they choose their own project. If the school gives students their own way to create their summer project, it can show teachers how they work when they present them when the students go back to school. Allowing students to show off their skills can show both students and teachers what that student can do, and he/she can inspire other students to become more creative when there is another project that is assigned to them. ",3,2,98
6BFE57AA416B,"Conclusion.If they have to work on a project that is designed by a teacher, how would they ever feel motivated to actually learn from the project that they have to do? If a student gets to design their own project, they can pick their own project that it is interesting to them, and take their time to actually learn from it. Myself for example, I learn better when I have more fun, and when I find ways to make it more enjoyable. 
",3,0,83
6BFE57AA416B,"Conclusion.However, students would barely learn anything about the topic that is chosen for them, because they are forced to work on that topic. Also when the students are back in school and they have to present their projects, the other students might not even pay attention to their classmates presenting, because they would already know the information that is going to be said. The classmates that I've talk to in my school state to my that they have more fun with a project when they get to pick their own topic to choose from, and tend to pay attention more to when their classmates present different projects topics.

72ECF408E30D,"Conclusion.They are capable of thinking more creatively about certain questions, are more comfortable and as a result better when giving presentations in front of the class, and cna even perform better in Physical Education. Extracurricular activities, while not solely responsible for this, are a large factor that affects how a student performs in the classroom. For example, Model United Nations is one activity which teaches students about various useful skills, like public speaking. Students stand up in front of the entire class giving a speech, sometimes off the top of their head, on a certain problem affecting the intense world today. Model UN is not only a useful educational tool, however, as it is also capable of helping students think about the world with a new perspective. Many topics given are about finding better solutions to certain issues prevalent in today's world. Students come out of this club brimming with new ideas, self-confidence, and a will to learn. Sports are another activity beneficial to students. They learn skills such as teamwork, cooperation, and even get better sleep at night. One example of this is soccer, which teaches students about endurance and teamwork, all while helping them exercise. These student athletes are able to perform better in the classroom as well as in P.E. because of their athletic capabilities.

College is a big part of life not just in the United States, but all over the world. By going to college, one can get a better education and in turn, a better job. However, just getting good grades in school is not enough for many of the top colleges around the world. Students also need a hook that make them stand out from the others in the eyes of the university. In fact, some colleges have given out scholarships to students for extracurricular activities. For example, playing a musical instrument, like the piano. Not only does this help with how a student does in the classroom, but colleges also look for students with musical talents and even partner with music schools for this purpose. In this way, not only can students attend a college, but they can also attend the music school that comes with it and pursue their musical education as well. ",3,2,374
72ECF408E30D,"Conclusion.Extracurricular activities benefit students in their performance in the classroom, attainability of higher education, and physical and mental health. ",3,0,20
72ECF408E30D,"Conclusion.For example, one may take piano lessons with a private teacher, or play on a travel soccer team with no association to the school. By forcing these students to have to pick up another extracurricular activity that is provided by the school, they may become overwhelmed with trying to manage their busy schedules. Then, all of the positive attributes of physical activities fall apart. This reason is why the decision of the principal should be changed so that only students who do not participate in any extracurricular activity of any kind will be required to take one. Otherwise, there will be drawbacks to the principal's otherwise good intentions. ",3,2,109

These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus."" This piece of text from the passage shows that if anything were to happen to Earth, Venus would be our closet option for a planetary visit because Venus is one of our planetary neighbors and closet to Earth at times. ",3,0,79
7BE3B580C5DB,"Conclusion.The first paragraph introduces the topic of Venus with an interesting hook, but does not give the reader their side. The reader needs a thesis, without one the reader is not going to be able to have their opinion on a topic swayed. The author's current attempt at a thesis statement , ""While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved very challenging place to examine more closely,"" does not state what side they are on clearly. Their best declaration of the side they are on is in their very last paragraph. The author wrote, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" This is a very strongly worded thesis, but would have been much better if placed in the starting paragraph. Their side on the topic was acknowledged, but not as well as it could have been if they had set up their thesis correctly. ",3,2,176
7BE3B580C5DB,"Conclusion.The author is for the exploration of Venus, but consistently chooses to bring up the problems that doing so faces. The author writes about the difficulties about exploring Venus, because of the planet's extreme environment. They opposed their own side in paragraph three by saying, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" This is an affective strategy, because people who may oppose exploration to Venus may say something similar to this. The author is arguing their own point to establish reliability and trust amongst with people who favor not exploring Venus. The author showing that they see the problems with exploring Venus shows that they are open minded and open to their mind being changed, and this will in turn have the reader do the same. ",3,2,156
7BE3B580C5DB,"Concluding Statement.The author of ""The Callenge of Exploring Venus"" did a fair job when arguing that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. While the author did accurately present the dangers and solutions for the dangerous parts of exploring Venus, they failed to create a strong thesis. The author exceeded when giving factual information about the topic to help the reading get on their side of the arguement; do to them struggling to get across their position on if Venus exploration is worthwhile, some of the provided information they gave was not used to it's full potential when changing the reader's opinion.

Although hands-free devices do not increase safety, but causes the same amount of distraction as if one were holding a phone. They both serve the same purpose when it comes to distracting the driver from paying attention to the road. Studies show that the reaction time significantly reduces when paying attention to a phone rather than the road for an aged person. Now imagine how much more this affects an elderly person.

This then leads to them having nowhere to go, leaving them with something they don't enjoy. If the school doesn't have a club or activity that suits them, then they shouldn't have to participate in one. If they do, it's just extra work that'll bore them. Clubs are supposed to be enjoyable, and help students find others that have the same interests as them, but if participating in a club or activity is mandatory, students may feel left out, and not included. They may be excluded and picked on for having a talent that others can't relate to,or be picked on for not being good at something. ",3,2,133

The study discovered that most students who were involved in clubs, student council, sports, and etc. answered with higher numbers of friends, many of which they made through their out of school activities. This shows that you don't only just learn a trade catered to your interests, but you also meet lots of new people who share those interests and become your closest relative friends. You could even meet your soul mate! At Harvard University, the students studied married couples and found that over 70% of their top ten passions and interests were shared, that's 7 out of 10!

This was to help clean the smog infested air in the dense city. Although many delivery companies complained about lost revenue, congestion within the capitcal lowered by 60 percent. By Monday that week, ""the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuesday"". In another article called ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", this one tells how Bogota, Columbia has also banned cars to promote alternate transportation and reduce smog. The ban is only for one day a year (called The Day Without Cars), but it's helped cause the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, new, smoot sidewalks, less traffic, and new restaurants and shopping areas.

85983B2516C5,"Conclusion.In the third passage of the artice, the author states, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness ... and then associated each with charactersitic movements of the facial muscles,"" meaning that the software associated voluntary or involuntary movements of the face with emotions. The problem with this system is that students can change the look of their face quite easily, and can thus convince the computer to produce desired results, making the system disfunctional. There are quite a few reasons children, especially young ones, would want to make the software not work, including tricking the computer into moving from the original learning program into a more desired one and them simply wanting to see the program fail through their abilities. ",3,2,120
85983B2516C5,Conclusion.The idea of being able to find out the emotions of all of the chidlren in a school on a whim also rises privacy concerns that would need to be addressed before any program including this software would be implemented. ,0,2,41

At the Mobile World conress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chir man of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a bsiness plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. he proposed partnering with the telecommunications inustry to create cities in which pedestian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportaion traffic are woven into a cconneted network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.

Levittown and Scarsdale, Newy York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of thw 1950s and still exert a strong appeal.

8BFA8777316F,"Conclusion.As a shy person, when I first came to my school I was struggling to find some good friends that I could trust. Later on I decided to join a chess club and a drawing club and I made great friends. Joining a extracurricular activity can give shy students a way to to train on socializing, meaning that they could practice how to socialize and even overcome their fear of socializing by talking to people in their extracurricular activity. At school, some students who are not shy can be very loud and disruptive during class. If these students join a extracurricular activity, they will not want to socialize as much during class because they will have a extracurricular activity that they could join and talk and share their opinions there. Extracurricular activities are very helpful towards students who want to make some friends and socialize, so therefore making students participate in at least one is necessary. ",3,2,157

90345B5B064D,"Conclusion.Given the freedom to pursue one's take on a subject, helps foster self-confidence. In my high schoolÂ experience, doing a personal research that was interesting really helped create a sense of pride and accomplishment. Being confident leads to trusting one's ability rather than relying on others;and in our competitive society for careers, self-reliance is extremely important. Furthermore, allowing students to pursue their own designs lets them mature into adulthood. The apex of self reliance is adulthood and self learning is meant to teach and prepare students for their future. By removing the dependency of a teacher when doing a project, self support truly shines through, giving students hands on experienceÂ on the hallmark of adulthood. This is similar to the concept of parents not supporting a baby for too long so they can learn to walk on their own. ",3,2,140

909404A6C673,"Conclusion.For example, in an interior design class, the summer project could be to design the students' dream house. One student may excel in drawing, so they could draw their dream house. Another student may excel in graphic design, so they could create a three-dimensional model of their dream house on a computer. Lastly, another student may like Legos, so they could build their dream house out of Legos. On the other hand, teacher-designed projects would minimize the creative freedom because they would set specific guidelines on how they want their students to complete it. All in all, students can complete their projects using the unique skills they have with student-designed projects. 
",3,2,112
909404A6C673,"Conclusion.Generally, students put more effort into the subjects that they enjoy. Similarly, if students are able to design their own projects, they would enjoy completing the projects and work harder on them. If the previously mentioned interior design teacher required everyone to build their dream house out of Legos, the student who draws and the student who enjoys graphic design would enjoy the project less and find little motivation to complete it over the summer. As a result, the drawer and graphic designer would put minimal effort into their Lego dream house, for they may just build a house with little detail and minimal unique thinking. On the other hand, if the dream house project was a student-designed project, the students would put a lot of effort into creating their dream house since they are able to design it with the skills that they have and enjoy using.

In the story it said, in August 1945,Luke and Don bolth got there orders to go to New Orleans. Luke and Don arrived they day the war ended. the they went to greece Luke turned 18 before arriving at greece and Luke might be able to get drafted foe the millitary.

Accroding to the text, By the time Luke was drafted he had already made 9 trips the most of any seagoing cowboy. Luke was traviling from the Atlantic Ocean to the eastern caost of the united states. Luke said it took about two weeks to cross the Alantic Ocean and a mounth to get to China. Luke was carring for the animals that were crossing and they had to fed and waterd two or three times a day.

the animals food had to be pulled from the lower holds of the ship so they could eat. Luke was prepard for this because he had to help out on his aunts farm.

928548A07586,"Conclusion.What if I said that there are computers that can identify students emotions during class, well if you thought that was fake its actually real! Recently we've made this new technology called the Facial Action Coding System that allows computers to show human enotions and even things like paintings.

There are many outgoing students, but there are also many introverted students. Some students may not feel confident enough to ask for something to be repeated, so they may simply sit at their desks puzzeled for the rest of the class, while a simple question could've avoided this. If this technology is instituted, it will automatically know when a student isn't confident on the information and alert the teacher. By doing this, the introverted student won't be confused for very long and the topic could be revisited without the student to have to personally ask. It not only will help introverted students, but students across the board. Every student will benifit form this technology and will display in their grades. With this technology, the students acedemic achievements will expand exponentially. ",3,2,157

9579E25F6CCC,"Conclusion.Going out of your comfort zone can really help you feel better about yourself, and not just keeping to yourself. Some Evidence for this is that, in a study taken by the Social Interaction and Communication Association, 60% of students that keep to themselves have lower than average self esteem. This would make sense seeing how if they always keep to themselves, they don't really have anyone to comfort them in their darker times, which this rule could help prevent. More Evidence that highlights this point is when Zachary Andrews, A College student from Colombia, had this to say, ""I honestly never really talked to that many people when I was younger, I didn't really like myself, and didn't think I deserved friends, but when my parents made me join the basketball team, I met and found people that I got along with really well,"". This would show that their is still hope for people that have low self esteem, that just have to have help taking the big step. ",3,2,172
9579E25F6CCC,"Concluding Statement.
Overall, I feel that I have made many points and examples on why students should have to do at least one extracurricular activity. Such as it helping you make new friends, it can help them discover hobbies, it improving confidence and team building skills, and how we shouldn't focus on the minority when it comes to this rule. This rule can really help so many people that can't break out of their shells on their own, and really save them from a dark future without any support to help them through it ",1,2,94
957EE90E67F9,Concluding Statement.The author suggests studying Venus because of humans are curious about this planet. I know this because NASA is approching to studying about Venus. Another reason is because NASA has future plans to send human to Venus. Final reason is because Venus looks similar to earth. This is why the author suggest studying about Venus. ,1,0,57
958BACFAF66B,"Conclusion.Someway scientist have thought of some way to possibly research the mysterious planet, NASA has created a so called 'blimp' that would allow the scientists to be able to hover over Venus landscape 30 miles up. At 30 miles up, Venus would be at a 170 degrees Farenheit and pressure would be what it seems like at sea level on Earth. It is not easy conditions, but survivable for humans. Although, most forms of light can't penetrate the dense atmosphere, concerning standard forms of photography and videography ineffective or not clear. There would not be any samples of rock, gas, or anything else that would be of use. To have a thorough mission and search, you would have to get up close and personal, despite the risks, and danger.

95A558C8882D,"Conclusion.
Venus is often called the Earths sister, or twin. Venus has a realitively similar size to Earth and is actually the closest in distance to Earth. Scientist believe, altought not able to land on Venus, that Venus has a similar surface to Earth as well. Scientist say that Venus has a rocky surface and, as the article says, ""... features such as valleys, mountains, and creaters"" (paragraph 4). With this, it is also believed that Venus once had oceans. If Venus had oceans, there is a chance that Venus can support life on its surface.

Not only is there a posibility that Venus might have had water, the air pressure is very similar to the sea levels on Earth. In Paragraph 5, the article says ""... the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth"". This means that those who lived on Venus would not be crushed by the weight of the air pressure. On other planet the air pressure is heavy enough to crush a person and is not suitable to live on.

Not only can the surface temperature be high, but there is 97% level of carbon dioxide in Venus' atmophere. Scientist have proven that humans would only withstand three weeks on Venus because of these conditions. ",3,0,85

There is still so much more to explore on Venus. But for now we know that the air pressureis similar to Earths sea level pressure, it is close to the sun having pleanty of solar power, and is once believed to have oceans and support life.

964639CCF90C,"Conclusion.venus is one of the brightest point of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to sopt.

Venus is the secoynd planet from our sun.

Venus is also referred to as Earth's twin, Venus is also the clostest planet in distance.

Venus is sometimes right around the coner in space terms, humas have sent numerous spacecraft to land in the cloud-draped world and no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.

Venus has not been touch by any spaceship for more than three decades.

The article also said, ""on the planet's surface, temperatures averge over 8-- degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving in the deepest part of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.""

At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.

Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not ecceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans. ",3,1,209

96B312BD472F,"Conclusion.The goal of these assignments is to help the students fortify their knowledge over summer so that it is not lost. These teachers go through years of university studying the subject that they teach, so why should a student who has taken the class for one year have authority over summer assignments. For example, AP BC CalculusÂ is an immense subject with a variety of different units of math. If a student tried to make a summer study guide, they would only have a year of experience under their belt. On the other hand, teachers, who have been teaching/studying this subject for years, have a strong understanding of each unit and how to teach it in a unique way. The credibility of the creator of the assignment must be strong, so the student can have an easier time understanding the subject. Thus, teachers should be assigning summer assignments. ",3,2,149

98EB307EB4CC,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion, summer projects should be designed by teachers and not students. While some say that students should design the projects as they know what they can handle, teachers have a degree in knowing what a student can handle.

Although the curriculum calls for practice in rhetorical analysis, it does not discuss proper thesis writing: our instructor assigned us work for both of these. Every dedicated student in the class was not only prepared for the work we were given, but we were confident in our abilities to accomplish these assignments.

9BEB8A30BE1B,"Conclusion.""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"", Rosenthal writes in ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"". By driving less, we can reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" by Robert Duffer, is a prime example of the reduction of air pollution after limiting car usage. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"", writes Duffer. One Friday, the smog of Paris ""rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"". On the following Monday, motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a $31 fine. After only one day with less cars on the roads, the smog had nearly dissappeared. This shows that even a day with less cars can make a huge difference in the amount of air pollution. Rosenthal's article, "" The End of Car Culture"", states that many sociologists believe that if the pattern of less cars continues, ""it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" because transortation is America's second largest sourse of carbon emissions. Less air polution is a very important advantage of less cars.

This will reduceÂ the anxiety faced by students because they already have an idea about the kind of work assigned in that class. Students will also get a head start on concepts learned for the next school year. When students enter school, they won't be confused when they start to learn because they already had practice on these concepts on the summer project. This makes academics much easier for students and allows them to have an understand even before the upcoming school year. Furthermore, if students are prepared for concepts learned for the next school year, it will remove the negative connotation that students have with school. Students often don't like school because it is challenging or they do not understand what is being taught.

There is no way they will be prepared to come back to school and preform well in the class.

From playing music in the shower to using phones to keeping daily tasks organized, cell phones have grown to become an essential part of human life. It is hard to deny that cell phones have become so infused in our daily lives. This has caused many to pose the question as to whether or not cell should be allowed to be used in any capacity when operating a vehicle.

When operating a cellphone while driving, the drivers eyes can be taken off the road from anywhere to a few seconds to a few minutes. Driving is not a perfect situation. People constantly break,stop, speed up, and slow down. Taking eyes off the road for even one second can cause a serious accident on the road. The president of the National Safety Council reported that talking on a cellphone while driving makes one four times more likely to get in a crash. Talking on a phone is such a risk that the National Safety Council has called for a total ban on cell phone usage when driving due to the fact that 100 million people use their phones in a day. Using a cell phone when driving can not only jeopardize the drivers life but also passengers in their car and others on the road. Driving while using a device has the ability to cause a premature death when the drivers are distracted.

Instead of the teachers spending so much time in the beginning of the year going back over what we learned the year before they can just get right into the lesson because what needed to be reviewed has already been refreshed in our memories over the summer because of the project.

A4E6E2D5658D,"Conclusion.When people think of summer they think of fun, traveling, relaxation, and most importantly no school work.

Students work tirelessly all year, summer is students' free time, and if students have to work during their free time it should be under their regulation what their assignments consist of.

Students creating their own assignments can be more enjoyable, stipulating their interests and help them learn information and lessons.

School projects over the summer assigned by teachers can come in bulk and most of the time is boring.

But, if students developed their own assignments for the summer then it could possibly be more enjoyable and help them learn more, for example a student would enjoy creating a graphic image project of information versus writing a paper that a teacher would normally assign.

Allowing students to take the lead and create their own projects can relieve the stress of summer work by them making it pertain to their interests.

A4FBD7A27089,"Conclusion.Students in America struggle throughout their life attending school while accepting the burden of friendships, family and other stresses and anxieties. Summer becomes that safe haven for them, to completely decompress from their issues and take a break from the mental strain of schools, with all the tests, exams and projects that're encompassedÂ within it. Students who are allowed the opportunity to design their own project become eager to create a product which displays their learning over the summer. Once in my freshman year, I was given an option to complete a teacher-assigned book report, or to construct an independent book report. Being allowed this opportunity made me eager to chose a book that satisfied my interests, and not be punished to endure reading a four hundred page book about trivial history. This point illustrates the impact that student-designed summer projects can instill, without the students feeling punished by the school. Learning should be a process of critical thinking and analysis, however when this process is interrupted by an external predetermined body it is detrimental to one's education. ",3,2,179

AB02689C1A9B,"Conclusion.In Germany, residetns have given up on cars. Vauban's streets are completely ""car-free"", except the main throughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge are only two places to park.

70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and the 57 percent sold a car to move there. Some say they feel happier now than before when they had a car. Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. Greenhouse gas emissions are reduced drastically. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the U.S.

In the new approach to make cities denser, and better for walking stores are being placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. In teh U.S., the Enviornmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legistors are starting to act, if cautiously. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other tansport.

After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters, an international news agency headquartered in London; 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.

President Obama's goal to curb the U.S.'s greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week. Recent astudies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.    ",3,1,334

AB0403712FA9,"Conclusion.Grades make or break people. Grades determine whether or not you get the job or you don't get the job, they give you life but they can also take it away. When a student get good grades joy floods into their life, their parents are proud, their teachers are proud, you auto-matically become glowing like a star. But when bad grades come along they contribute to stress, and usually your parents are not proud, neither are your teachers. Bad grades send students plummeting to rock bottom. Extracurricular activities are a leading cause in bad grades because they provide less time to study, do homework, sleep, and get the better grade. And when it comes to after school clubs they might not seem big but they are, they take away even more time and money because of all the competitions and contributions you have to make to those type of things. After school activities are a roller coaster that only goes up once in a blue moon. They effect you negatively, and it's not right to force them upon students. ",3,0,180

ABC4770058F6,"Conclusion.If kids tried to create a Summer project, it would most likely result in an easy assignment that would take no effort. This would destroy the entire purpose of the summer assignment and give no benefit to the student. But if teachers designed it, then it would more likely be a project of an acceptable rigor. The projects needs to be challenging enough that it keeps kids engaged in learning so they will benefit from it.

ABC4770058F6,"Conclusion.If a couple teachers get together and make the Summer project it would be easy for them to make a rubric to go along with it. If the students make the Summer project then it would be much more of complicated .

The studentsÂ would most likely have to brainstorm ideas and pick one for the project which would take time, then pitch the idea to the teachers and wait for approval, and then after all that is done the teachers have to use a project that they did not make to create a rubric for grading.

AD3FFB7CA387,"Conclusion.One of the largest issues for parents in today's world is trying to get their children away from the computer, television, and cell phone. Technology has lessened the need for toys and books, since children entertain themselves with games on their tablets or books they download also on the tablet. But cars play a big part in this. When a person first gets a car, he/she feels free. You feel like the world is yours because you can go anywhere. But the problem is that people become less social with cars. Instead of going to play a sport with some friends, most people would rather drive somewhere else. It is also the reason the United States is ranked second in country with the most overweight people, vehicles are so unexpensive here that anyone is able to purchase a car and drive to their destination instead of riding a bicycle or skateboard and getting some real exercise. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks"" (Selsky 28). This also shows the improvement on the cities' sidewalks and the increase of people attending parks. Without cars, the streets look better and people recieve more exercise. ",3,2,206
AD3FFB7CA387,"Conclusion.Electric cars are a new invention, and for the past decade they have been atempting at perfecting an electric car. The brand,

Tesla , has already released a few electric cars that seem to work quite well. The vehicles make no noise when driving, and they even have a new ""sportsy"" look to them, for th young adults that want a nice looking car. But the only problem is the battery. Electric cars are being banned in some states due to the lack of reliability with these batteries. They have not yet been perfected, and can cause accidents. But even with the risk one would be taking while driving one of these cars on the streets, it is still a fantastic replacement for normal cars, since it does not release anything that can harm the environment. So the best solution would be to wait a few years until the batteries get better and the prices drop, then purchase an electric car, but still know when to stop using it and ride the bicycle instead. ",3,0,174
AD3FFB7CA387,"Conclusion.Combining the use of a battery rather than gasoline, and not overusing the car, you will have the perfect combination, which is what everybody should strive to accomplish. Help the environment, and get the right amount of exercise. ",5,2,39
AD3FFB7CA387,"Concluding Statement.In the end, cars are still one of the most common and one of the greatest things on Earth today. Getting a first car is a dream come true, but too much of it can be harmful. So get some use out of the bicycle, avoid poisoning the atmosphere, and cars will be a vehicle with no reprocautions at all, and it will be the perfect source for transportation, while keeping your morals where they should be.

AE0BBF382263,"Conclusion.Venus poses several dangerous obsticles to pursuit because of how dangerous the planet actually is, which makes the time of pursuing the planet not reasonable and not worth the time for scientist ",5,0,33
AE0BBF382263,"Conclusion.In paragraph 2, the author says, ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.

AE0BBF382263,"Conclusion.Instead, focus on another planet that is well worth the time and money of a spacecraft. It would only take moments for the spacecrafts to be liquefied after standing on Venus's surface.

AE37AE3F79C7,"Conclusion.After the school year ends, students return to their homes feeling a great sense of relief that the school year is over, and that they're about to get a much needed break. However, just because school has stopped doesn't mean that learning should. Three entire months off is long time, and many students actually forget most of what they learned over the past year and need to be refreshed when they return to school. It would save everyone a lot of time if students came back to school with the last year's information still fresh in their minds. The simple solution to this problem is summer assignments. ",4,2,108
AE37AE3F79C7,Conclusion.will be something the student is more passionate about ,0,0,10
AE37AE3F79C7,"Conclusion.Typically, in a learning context, more passion or excitement transfers to more success at whatever it is the students are trying to learn. Being more passionate about something causes people to interact with it much more, and interaction is key to the learning of many students. In addition, students being excited to do something furthers the self-motivation mentioned above. If there is something that a student wants to do, they will do it without needing a teacher to tell them to. Overall, the passion that comes from student-designed summer work makes it a much more fun and more effective experience for students. ",3,2,103
AE6BABB53D5E,"Conclusion.Students should be allowed to explore their interests on their own, as opposed to being forced to participate in something they barely have any connection with. The best way for a student to succeed is to build upon something they already have skills or an interest in, and the activities that the school promote do not cater to each individual student. This new rule promotes involuntary participation and will possibly make teenagers resilient to exploring their interests and values. ",3,2,80

AF3D63DA7CB4,"Conclusion.Cars are one of the main sources for people's stress, whether it be because of car failures, others who annoy you while you drive, or the fact you can never find a parking spot.Â  Heidrun Walter claims "" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much mappier this way ( In German suburb, Life goes on without Cars 3)."" One main reason people are less tense and stress is because people do not have to constantly worry about if another car is about to hit them, if traffic is going to be to slow to get to work, or if your car is going to breakdown on you. Car's create unwanted stress that can be easily avoided. Indeed life would be very different without cars people in Bogota, Paris, and Germany have all been able to function properly without motorized vehicles.Â  In fact ""70 percdent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold cars to move her (In German Suburbs, Life goes on without Cars 3).""

AF637B7047FB,"Conclusion.There are numourus extracurricular clubs that dont base around education and fitness and these clubs, I would say improve a students social skills. One example of this is the after school tech theater club. This club comes togetherÂ for about a month to help with the technical side of a Rambunctious theater show. In this club you get to meet new people and are able to help out your department. There are many departments in this club ranging from sound technician to costume and makeup technician. To join this club you have to submit an application and select what department you would like to be in for the production. This department requires team work with your other technicians and I think that this club is a good way to make new friends and teach better social skills. ",3,2,138

AFCF10293B9A,Conclusion.I think it would be great to have something like this. The process beings when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of your face. They would go through all 44 of your major face muscles because in order for them to work they must move like human muscles. Dr. Paul Eckman the creator of FACS has classified 6 very important emotions then mixed them together with each with facial muscles. ,3,0,72
AFCF10293B9A,"Conclusion.This coding system is very smart and can tell if you are doing a fake smile of some sort. If you use a fake smile the system will tell if you are because when you are the mouth is streched sideways using the zygomatic major wih some different muscles. To an expert they said ""faces don't lie"" these muscle clues are often sometimes used to spot if a celebrity or a politician is being truthful. ",3,0,76
AFCF10293B9A,Concluding Statement.So I have came to conclusion that this facial action coding system works on any and everyone to tell their true emotions.                ,1,0,24
AFD739EDDEA9,"Conclusion.The author describes ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" and how a new technology called the Facial Action Cording System enables compures to identify human emotions.

If any one of these reliable sources does not know, I can most likely look it up on one of my devices that has the internet ",4,2,60
B07E96B9767C,"Conclusion.Not every school has computers and not every class uses them. If we were to implement this software, it could be giving an unfair advantage to the students who had acsess to it. There are still plenty of schools that may not have a computer in every classroom. Similarly, not all students and parents can afford this kind of technology. Because of how new and high-tech this software is it most likely will cost more money to be put into effect. This would cause the schools with more money to be able to get it while the schools with less funding and less money to be pushed aside and not get it. This causes the students at the schools that cannnot afford it to have a disadvantage. ",3,2,128

B0EB441FDE3A,"Conclusion.In this essay I will be giving an argument on why this so called ""face"" is not made by aliens.

The prompt tells you that one of your colleagues says that it is created by aliens.

My job in this essay is to tell why it isn't and give an explanation.

The figure that NASA saw was a so called ""face on mars"".

They claimed that it was in the shape of a human head and it was thought to be made by aliens. ",4,0,85
B0EB441FDE3A,"Conclusion.Here is a reason why.

All these years NASA has gone to a two or three planets looking for aliens.

Throughout the years how many have we found, none! ",0,0,30
B0EB441FDE3A,"Conclusion.Yes, we may have found some traces of aliens, but we can not prove that these are actually alien tracks, or alien lifeforms.

There is no way to prove that this structure was made by aliens, unless we have images of them, and so far we have none. ",3,0,49
B0EB441FDE3A,"Conclusion.Yes, you may be right in some way.

Yes, we have found traces of aliens over the years.

This COULD have been made by aliens.

Maybe they are trying to connect to other life outside of their planet.

That is the only argument that you have against me. ",2,0,49

B216794ACCCA,"Conclusion.including the fact that, ""such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans"" (paragraph 3). At this point in the article, the idea of having a human explore and study Venus up close in unthinkable. ",3,2,45
B216794ACCCA,"Concluding Statement.From the very first descriptions of the idea the author is trying to bring across, the audience is turned away from the author's opinion. The tone set sways the audience toward one direction of the conflict while the author is in the other direction. The author went too far into detail about the dangers that can come from studying Venus and di not have evidence of how it would be safe and possible at all. The author's idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers was not supported through their ideas or evidence.         ",1,2,98
B2426E4674E7,"Conclusion.Additionally, the author uses evidence about how landing on Venus is possible to support their idea that it is a worthy pursuit. ",0,2,23
B24EE1A93A0B,"Conclusion.Its would be amazing if NASA could get samples of the rock, gas, and other things on Venus. ",0,0,19
B24EE1A93A0B,"Conclusion.The reason it would be amazing is so that we can know how Venus is just like our earth they call Venus Eath's ""twin"" so it would be amzaing if they had a lot more in common. NASA is willing to send people there but the only problem is that it is to hot there for people to go there and land there and take samples. The only way NASA said they could send people was if thyey could hover over Venus at about thirty miles or so, that is about how high a jet airplane fly. NASA would like to make things so that humans do not have to risk there lives to get samples so NASA is making some things in the articule it says this ",3,0,129
B24EE1A93A0B,Conclusion.After all would you decide to help out and figure out more about Venus? Scientist are doing a great job so far with everything they are figuring out about what could be more helpful to them. They also know that is can be safe for them to hover over Venus instead of landing on it and having a horrible tragidy. ,5,1,61

B3176BB24009,"Conclusion.In the excerpt, ""The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckham Institute for Advanvced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam,"" shows just how recent this technology is. (D'Alto 1). With this in mind, if students were able to be introduced and subject to this technology, there could be future scientist that want to further improve this technology and, until then, would be more involved in it's place at school. (D'Alto 1). Also, due to the fact that this technology is not only limited to the classroom, it is then evident that other jobs could be produced out of this technology being in the classroom, sparking interest in young and vulnerable students. As the author includes, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive--for video games or video surgery,"" it is showsn just exactly how various the fields are that this technology could be used in. (D'Alto 6). Whether a kid is devoted to learning about medicne or engrossed in playing games, it has been shown that this technology in the classrooms would expose these kids to it's capabilities and potentially create a passion. (D'Alto 6). Therefore, by including this technolgy in the classroom with it's own purpose, the students would be subject to technolgy that is blooming in several fields and could easily inspire a child to become something that utilizes this technology in their future.

B51E027B51AF,Conclusion.In 1976 Viking 1 snapped a photo of Mars. Viking 1 spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. Many people think it was created by the life on Mars. Many people think that it is just a natural landform. There was no alien creation after all. ,4,0,48
B51E027B51AF,"Conclusion.NASA took a picture ""3 times bigger than the pixel size."" So if there was an object like a airplane on the surface of Mars, you would be able to see what the object was. Turns out that the picture showed a butte or mesa. 
",3,0,47
B51E027B51AF,"Conclusion.""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho,"" says Garvin. The mysterious face turned out to be a butte. Not a Alien artifact. Each pixel in the 2001 photo spans 1.56 meters. compared to 43 meters per pixel in the Viking 1 photo. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars,"" said Garvin. ",3,0,75
B51E027B51AF,Conclusion.NASA is apart of the Government. The Government lies all the time. ,2,1,13
B57C860BE032,Conclusion.They look like wind or a storm formed them. In face one it look's like there is alot of wind when NASA took the picture. In face two it kinda revels a little more . What im thinking is there had to have been a storm or strong wind for face one to be so blury. ,3,0,56
B57C860BE032,Conclusion.Think about this if these structure's were man made or alein made they wouldn't look like this ,0,1,18
B57C860BE032,Conclusion.so what is that telling us. Another reason is if it was man made it would be much smaller. These faces have to be natural landforms. Also to my understanding NASA has been watching the faces for a while. ,3,1,40
B57C860BE032,Conclusion.Then in picture three it is just totaly blown over. It seem's as if wind just keept blowing over then time and time agian. ,3,1,25

B6F03D0CEABE,Conclusion.Teachers are more experienced. With people that think that teachers are the best option for designing the project I do understand why. Students are young and may just want to take the easy route by not putting much effort into it. ,2,2,42
B6F03D0CEABE,"Conclusion.The guideline would explain the things needed for it and how it should be graded, and letting students know how it will be graded will help immensely when design it.

It will also help the students to figure out ideas for their design instead of them just being completely out in the open. So making a guild lineÂ will make both the teacher and students feel more secure and confident in the project being designed and completed.

B6F03D0CEABE,"Concluding Statement.Schools have to understand students better. With summer based projects being designed by the students they are able to have some fun doing it while also learning skills that are needed for both in school and out. Doing so helps them learn how to be independent and makes it so teachers will let them as well. So I do think that summer projects should be made by the students, because it helps them to learn independence, know when to take a break, and then let teachers know that they can do it but a little help at the start doesn't hurt.Â  ",1,2,103
B709F976724E,"Conclusion.He let his student calculating like math about facial movements human used to express their feeling. This is the 3D computer's face 44 major mucles in this model . Mr Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of Facial Action Coding

System. He has six emotional like happiness, suprise, anger, disguist, fear,and sadness. ""The facial expression for each emotion are universal "" He said with the unsimiling face. ""even though inviduals often show varing degees of expression"". An start the new sofeware to show them how Mona Lisa smile . Dr. Huang used da Vinci sofeware to show the muscle on her smile. The Mona Lisa demonstration to bring smile in her face ",3,0,119
B709F976724E,Conclusion.Use the technology to read student emotion that you can know the student if you don't understand the student or you are new teacher here. Some of student now they have a lot of trouble or sad story they try to hind . They try to be happy in froent of evryone. But at nigh or when they come back home hey will feel sad they cried all day all night. They will be a not social or can't focus on study so if we use that technology it will let the teacher know the feeling of each student. If they have any problem the teacher can help them figure out or help them overcome that feelunng and bring student the possituve feeling. ,3,0,123
B709F976724E,"Conclusion.The student look at the mirror and try to smile so they can see the changing of the smile.

B7819FA33B21,"Conclusion.If the assignment is designed by the students, it will appeal to them and they would take interest in it. If it was designed by a teacher, students will feel as if they have no choice in the matter, and must do as the teacher asks, thus removing the students interest from the assignment. Students will not feel as if they are having their summer taken away from them by the teacher, forcing them to do assignments. Since it was designed by the students, they would understand each other and know how much work would be too much, and what topics would appeal to them. This is why summer assignments should be student designed, because the students will actually want to get it done knowing they aren't being forced to do a project by the teacher. ",3,2,137

B867F487B9F3,"Conclusion.Personal automobiles and cars have played a major role throughout the world since the invention of the car in World War 2. Cars have been a very successful invention and many people drive their own every day on their way to work, school or other places their feet cannot carry them. Though the car has fulfilled its duties in making the lives of humans easier, it has also contributed to many negative events. For example, car emissions get trapped in the atmosphere and cause living things to breathe in dirty air around them. ",4,2,94
B867F487B9F3,"Conclusion.The continuing congestion and traffic jams that are among most areas of the world, create an enormous amount of stress for the people driving. Many develop road rage or irritability and are unhappy after suffering from a long ride home because of traffic. Some believe that cities should become more like Vauban, a community in Germany in which the citizens have given up their cars, because those who live there are not focused on driving and are pleased living in such a manner. Heidrun Walter, a mother who lives in Vauban, portrays her love for this car-free community when she states, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (Rosenthal). By living in an area with little or no use of cars, the society becomes more cheerful and has less stress to cope with. In addition, with no cars people are forced to spend more of their time outside to get from one place to another. In Bogota, Colombia there is an annual car-free day, in which anyone who does use their car has to pay a fine. Many spend their day outside walking or riding their bikes to get around and believe that the car-free day is ""a good opportunity to take away stress..."" (Selsky). As they exercise more without cars and enjoy the great outdoors, they wear bright smiles on their faces and look at things with a positive attitude. ",3,2,240

B8757E80EB9D,"Conclusion.how are we supposed to study it when it just keeps destroying our spacecrafts. We haven't tried it again in a decade. The reason to this is that Temperatures vary around 800 degrees fahrenheit. Venus has a thick atmosphere of 97% carbon dioxide. If us humans even take a step on Venus we get crushed. Venus has a 90% atomic pressure, which is greater than what we have on Earth. It could even crush a submarine and those are supposed to outstand pressure from the ocean. Venus isn't a very pretty planet either, it has a familiar features as valleys,mountains, and craters ",3,0,104

B8EAF80A1409,"Conclusion.Psychologist Erik Erickson developed the eight significant psycho socialÂ stages that outline the common conflicts experienced throughout a lifetime. In his seventh stage, known as ""integrity vs. despair,"" he describes the adulthood stage when people look back on their life. Many adults in this stage scroll through their overall progress and accomplishments. They decide if they spent their time wisely and lived a fulfilling life. If they look back at life and conclude that it was spent efficiently, they experience a sense of integrity. On the other hand, if they feel as if they did not make the most of their time on earth, they develop a terrible feeling of despair. It is important that students, being at such a young age, recognize the value of time. Although everyone remembers the saying ""life is short,"" many people forget to practice what they preach. If students are given teacher-designed projects, this will ensure that they efficiently spend their time during summer break.

B90C8C40C0A0,"Conclusion.The creativity of generation Z is outstanding and unique to modern day society. The opportunity for students to create the projects would be extraordinary and expressive of our generation. The use of creativity is very limited in school. You are to be complacent with the standards of your school through the strict rules and regulations they place. Many of the rules you are given are not only rigid but not needed. Teachers set boundaries on students and rarely let them experienceÂ and express their own style and flair. When students are allowed to indulge in their personal ambiance their limits are endless. This is embodied through art and the publishing of students in modern day. More books written by teenagers are selling on the shelves today, than ever before. ",3,2,130
B90C8C40C0A0,Conclusion.By doing this they lose the chance to see the passions and talents of the individual students. Consistent learning is needed but teachers lack the understanding that every student is different and have their own learning process and strengths. Modern day students recognize the differences throughout their peers and themselves. They notice that the differences unite them and it is ordinary to be different. Students who create the projects will implement the material to be expressive of their peers because they have the same mindset that comes with being in generation of identity and self-expression. Teachers do not see this aspect of learning they see learning targets and standards. ,3,2,110

Then they would have to choose a club that they do not enjoy, and would most likely not gain anything from their experience. Students will not gain any experience from the activities because it seems boring to them and they do not pay attention. I don't take any clubs because of the lack of time. There are some days however that I feel that I have no homework and I can do whatever I want to do. I try to join a club and there is nothing that interest me. I don't play any of the insanely popular sports, neither am I good at chess or other things. There is one club that I am interested in doing but they are only open on the days that I'm busy. I can join other clubs that my friends are in, but I will feel awkward because I don't know anything about certain topics. ",3,2,178

Making after school clubs required creates more problems, Not just for the students and teachers, but for the whole school. Think about what you would gain from the extra school classes, and how easy it is to get that experience by a different, easier method. Our schedule is so cramped we can't add anything else. Some of us might not have like any classes that are provided. Almost all of us would be tired from all the new things we have to do.

BBE1713D653B,"Conclusion.A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus, its even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric aciod in venus's atmosphere. it is usually 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and sometimes the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experince on our own planet. All thought these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth.

Also venus has the hottest surface temperture of any planet in our solar system. Even though mercury is closer to our sun. Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcannoes powerful earthquakes are frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

NASA is working on other approaches to studying venus. For an example some simplified electronics made of slilcon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. These devices were first envisioned in 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during world war II. Modern computers exidting in those days may sound schoking but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all.

Striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value not only because pf the insight to be gained on the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. ",3,1,232

Generic_Name had taken several vacation that summer with her family and never really had any down time to read and write a paper on the stories.

BFC824D7C408,"Conclusion.Everytime students hear the word school they all have a similar reaction: ""why school."" This reaction is due to the rigor of work school puts on students' backs and the repetition of constant learning. In order to give students time away, they are given three months of summer break which spans from June - August. During this time many kids choose not to continue learning and a negative effect of this is knowledge and memory decay. In order for their minds to be stimulized and conditioned to learn once school begins, schools are requiring students to complete summer projects. ",4,2,101
BFC824D7C408,Conclusion.Summer projects should be designed by students because they will be able to acquire knowledge in a way that interests them ,0,2,22
BFC824D7C408,"Conclusion.Students become boxed in boundaries due to the pressure of doing things a certain way and learning the way teachers tell them to. When students can design projects and learn in a way they believe is beneficial, learning becomes less of pressured task and more of a way to explore one's horizon. One thing students struggle with the most when completing assignments and projects is constant pressure. Students do not have the ability to express their ideas because they have to stick to an exact rubric. One of example of this is a science expo; many teachers tell the students what they should do for the project and don't give the students time to think about what interests them. This pressure of another voice constantly in their head makes learning and expression of ideas a struggle. In order for students to reach their full potential, they should be able to design in a way they are not boxed by others. ",3,2,161
BFC824D7C408,"Concluding Statement.Summer projects should be student-designed because students will be able to learn in a way which interests them and express their ideas without limitations and pressure by a teacher, on the other hand, teacher-designed projects would be beneficial to students because the content created by teachers is consistent with the content learned during the school year. Being able to acquire knowledge and learn in way which interests one self is very important throughout his/her life, however there are different goals for both the student and a teacher. The teacher's goal is to help the student succeed in a certain class, whereas the students goal is to learn what they want in a way which interests them. Having the right balance is very important and this balance can be obtained by students designing their own projects in the summer and teachers guiding students during the school year. This method will result in individuality development and the teachers can lead the students on the right path throughout the school year.Â  ",1,2,170

C3EEDCA21B42,"Conclusion.Throughout grade school we all had a hard time adjusting to diffrent teachers as well as their teaching methods. However, if every teacher were to create a summer project to match thier teaching methods, students would be able to adjust to diffrent teaching styles which, not only would benefit the student themselves but it would also their raise their grades dramatically.

C4C3A58C5939,"Conclusion.Since venus is so close to it makes it the second hottest planet in space. Its hard for them to examine it closely because how hot it could be on the planet so the sit safe at a certain vantage point.

Venus is close to earth witch makes itthe twin like in terms of density and size its close but distant a little from venus. So say if we get close to the sun earth woukd basically be like venus. Venus and earth is right around the corner from eachother so wat makes it different from eachother shouldnt the earth be hot too. To really think about it hot would it be if we were like venus.

The atmosphere is 97 perdent of carbon dioxide blankets venus which could really explain where the heat come from or take place in. Theres acid in venus atmosphere the pressure is 90 times worst than what it would usally be on earth. Its over 800 degress on that plante which makes it a baby sum or the son of sun. Venus has one if the worst tempature ever it gets so hot that it woukd kill us humans in a instant if we think about it. ",3,0,204

C5569B2725B4,"Conclusion.For me a car is very important , because if you have a car you can move to other places that you want . But not only that , if you have an emergency you can go rapidly,or in time . But this is not a facility in all countries and exist much problems with that , for example in Germany the street parking ,driveways and home garages , this are generally forbidden ,new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss. but in Vauban's streets are completly car free , this is so good , but with a limit ,likeÂ  except the main thoroughfare , where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs.

In conclucion:""As a result , 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars , and 57percent sold a car to move here"". And this is in source 1.

In source 2, in some countries exist prblems with traffic in the strees. One example is Paris ,"" 4,000 drivers were fined , according to Reuters ,27peoplehad their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. But the traffic go down 60 percent in the capital of France , after 5 days of intensifying smog . But of courseÂ  some countries have more that others , for example Paris typically has more smog than others europrean capitals , ""Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter ,per cubir meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London , Reuters found .

In Bogota, Colombia one day is celebreted as Car free day , but in onceÂ  year occur somthing different , millions of colombians hiked , biked , skated or took buses to work during this day , leaving the streets without traffic jams .

Paks and sports center also have bloomed throughout the city , uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad , smooth sidewalks ,Â  and others , restrictions have dramatically cut traffic . In conclucion the day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid 1990s . ",3,1,317

C5EDEF3A8C35,"Conclusion.it lets students know the expectations in the class, ",0,2,10
C5EDEF3A8C35,"Conclusion.If a student wrote a summer assignment paper about what they thoroughly know, it does not teach them anything new. They are not receivingÂ any new information, but on the contrary, if they were exposed to a new topic and researched about it, they would be able to retain new information and learn more. It could lead the students to more success to; if they are opened to new ideas and points of views, the student will learn more and be able to grow in knowledge rather than be stuck in the same perspective that they are in. For example, if a student was bias against the creation of country clubs and corporate made communities, but was to read about why those were created due to an assignment, he or she may have a shift in perspective and mind. This does not apply that he or she has changed their mind, but it has opened up their knowledge and gave them a fuller picture rather than it magnified.

Regardless, if students like the subject of research, or not, that practice will help them grow in writing, reading, and critical thinking skills as well. This increase in knowledge applies to when the teacher is designing the assignments. ",3,2,207

On planet's surface tempatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.

C71F197DD70A,"Conclusion.Venus has the hottest surface tempature of any planet in our solar system, though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking land on it's surface. If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface? Astronmers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of a rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains and craters. ",3,1,135

CA2987A57568,Conclusion.Making a project on a familiar concept means students would be able to write more in-depth about it. They'd also be able to understand it better since looking something up doesn't always give you enough info about a subject. Imagine trying to write a in-depth analysis on Didgeridoos when you've never even heard of one or even have background information on instruments.

CCF447CCADB3,"Conclusion.Sally Sue, secretary of the Bayview High Middle School say that, ""Finding out who you are and your strengths is a very important thing for this world and who you want to become."" That is a very good thought, I think that who you are is an important thing for you to figure out. Even from just doing a silly extracurricular activity you can find out what you are good at and what you can accomplish for life up ahead. I know a friend who is doing a yearbook and photography club, and maybe that is her way of finding out if she wants to do photography when she is older or not. It is a great way to find out if you want to do it in the future. ",3,2,132
CCF447CCADB3,"Conclusion.One thing PROPER_NAME from SCHOOL_NAME suggest, ""Lot of kids are in different programs here, but not a lot of the kids know each other. We purposely put kids in different groups to learn about each other."" That is a cool idea. I feel that at our school not everybody knows each other, having those actives, I believe could solve that. For example, I was in this club at my school and I had no friends in it and I didn't really like it because of that. Then I started talking to people and I started to become really good friends with some people that I am still friends with to this day. ",3,2,114
CCF447CCADB3,"Conclusion.On the other hand, the activity does not have to be very long nor everyday and it could even be during school at the end of the day. For example, Timmy Lung from the Board of Supervisors argues ""When people thing about activities they think after school, but that is not the case. Activities can be during any time of the school day."" I agree with that, when we do Clubs at BRMS we do them at the end of the day. That way kids can go home and go and do homework and have time for their other sport. I know that if we had extracurricular activities after school then it would be hard for me because I have other sports to do and lots of homework on top of that.

CE120A8B4336,"Conclusion.Although Venus is analogous to Earth, there are slight differences of the two planets. Earth has average low and high temperatures, while the temperatures of Venus are more extreme. Paragraph 5 reads, ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiaton would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). ",3,2,87
CE120A8B4336,"Conclusion.As stated, the conditions would not be easy for humans, but survivable at the least. This supports the author's claim because this proves human life could be achieveable overall. ",0,2,30
CE120A8B4336,"Conclusion.Some issues still remain for the exploration, however NASA has already started preparing solutions. The heated state of the planet may be an issue, but NASA is studying a resolution. Paragraph 7 reads, ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This new technology created could lead to a long-lasting basis for human life, yet another reason exploring Venus is a brilliant idea. Modern technology is too fragile for the harsh heat of the planet, but with some older computers, that as well could survive on Venus. Paragraph 7 reads, ""The thought of (mechanical) computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This is yet another piece of technology on Earth and prepared for Venus ",3,2,186
CE94B3F26D2F,"Conclusion.For example, If the eleventh grade teacher gives all of her students a sheet of paper with a list of more than fifty books that the students are able to choose from, to help prepare them for next year, students know they have to read it and do all the work that comes along with it. But, if the students were able to design the project they could do, they would most likely choose the route that requires little to no effort to have to be put into it. They would choose the book that they have read over one hundred times in the third grade in which they have memorized every comic strip that was said in the book. Making sure that what is given to the students is actually going to help them in the long run and prepare them, shows the students that you truly care about their success in education. If students could design the project, they would do something the last week of summer that is, in which, super fast and easy and turn it in to the teacher the first day of school. ",3,2,190
CE94B3F26D2F,"Conclusion.They are the teachers and have gone through elementary, middle and high school just as most people have. But, they have also gone to college in order to be a teacher. They have learned specific material in which they need to know to become a teacher, regardless of the school. They have already have gone through their studies and have mastered the material. As students you are just now learning things as you grow and develop. To better understand, teachers go to school much longer than student to make sure that they know what they are doing and that they are able to teach the material to all different kinds of students. They know what we need to know and want to help prepare us for the new year abroad. Now if the students were to choose the project then they could possibly choose a subject in whichÂ is completely wrong and not needed for the following year to help you learn. ",3,2,163

CEBC3C34962E,Conclusion.The use of this technology to read students' emotional expressions is a good idea. ,5,0,15
CEBC3C34962E,"Conclusion.This article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile."" shows many examples or evidence that support my claim like; "" The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements--in a real face or in the paited face of the Mona Lisa. ",3,1,68
CEBC3C34962E,"Conclusion.Another example supporting my claim is "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. "" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" ",3,0,38
CEBC3C34962E,"Concluding Statement.This is a great and fun way to use technology, it will help teachers modify their lessons to fit not only the schools need of teaching but the students way of learning.

D0C6EB30D833,Conclusion.Did you know every summer students are assigned to summer reading? Students are required to read at least one book or more in order to stay engaged in learning. ,4,0,30
D0C6EB30D833,"Conclusion.By getting extra help, you able to work on your mistakes and fix them. In this case, you are free to get assistence from you teacher regarding any concept you do not understand and he or she will be more than welcome to help you. For example, incase you are working on an assignment that is math related and there happens to be a question you have worked on several times but still can not figure out, you will then find the need to explain your weaknesses to your teacher so that they work on a solution for your concerns and questions about that specific problem you are trying to solve. As a matter of fact, if you happen to be struggling with any particular subject having teacher-designed projects is more helpful and significant hence you are attaining help and directions from a professional person who understands what they are doinig as well as what you need help on a much higher level that outstand that of a student-designed one. That being said, a teacher-designed summer project is a perfect way to continue learning because you are not only being assisted by getting extra help on a specific assignment, but you are getting more knowledge and benefiting your education even when you are not in school. In other words, you are learning from your mistakes by fixing them with the right tools you need through your teacher and that results in you being more confident and comfortable on that very topic or project you had issues with in the first place. Indeed, getting extra help from you teacher will help you get better grades and following a well teacher-designed summer project will put you in good position for working hard and working on your communication skills as well as keeping your brain sharp and training it to endure any complex situations such as making sure you complete any due work and homework on time. ",3,2,325
D0C6EB30D833,"Conclusion.Because students are on vocations, this is their time to get caught up on their favorite hobbies and fun activities with their friends and one last thing they would want to think about is doing some sort of homework during their free relaxing time with family and friends moreover on a summer morning. For instance, lets say a student wants to hang out with friends on a saturday evening, but they remember they have a whole packet of work that was assigned to them before summer vocation and that by the end of summer before school starts, they have to finish it. The student will most liekly be worried and concerned about getting it over with and that means they will either cancell hanging out with friends and stay home doing random summer assigned homework on a saturday, but this is not the case when you know you are working with you teacher and that they will be able to walk you through all the work. Students surely worry less when they are working with a teacher on summer projects hence them doing something fun and relaxing in their free time sinc their teacher is available at any given point. School related projects or assignments are more easier to handle when your teacher is always there to work with you on that specific assigned assignment. As a result, students are much likely to enjoy their time away from school without anything bothering them for whatsoever case. Since students have already endured and served their time on the previous school year, they do not need any kind of aspect worrying them to the point where they have to stay home rather than them having fun and enjoying themselves and having a good time on a summer beach day while having fresh air and cooling off. Therefore, summer projects should be teacher-designed since students are not getting overwhelmed with what they need complete, but rather having some fun time with their friends and telling jokes and laughing them off with their relatives and maybe their pets who knows. ",3,2,347
D0C6EB30D833,"Conclusion.By doing so, teachers and students are most likely to get along with each other with no issues of any kind. Teachers are more than people who went to school and got their degree, but they are also regualr people just like everyone esle and at a certain point they become like family to us. So it is important for students to make sure they are in good terms with their teacher just in case they need help or guidance from the teachers, they will not get it if they behaved wrongly or cursed at their teachers which is something we often see in schools today. Well, if students and teacher manage to keep a steady and firm bond between one another, no obstacle or problem will come between their relationship, meaning they will be able to work with each other on a daily basis with no problematic concerns from either side.

D18B9F0D2CB4,"Conclusion.""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (5). In other words, cars are higly responsible for the harmful gases that pollute our atmosphere and cause global warming. In Paris,Â  a partial driving ban was issued to clear the air after days of high air pollution rates. After the driving ban, ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after five-days of intensifying smog"" (14). By using cars less, citizens can reduce pollution and help keep our earth clean and safe. Statisticts show that fewer peopleÂ  are using cars around the world. ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009"" (41). Sociologists belive that this trend will continue and possibly increase.

There is a boy at my school that we are going to call Generic_Name. Generic_Name does not understand the WWI subjets in his history class. He's been doing his class and homework, been paying attention, he's been writing his notes, but he still does not understand the subject. He's asked his teacher for extra help and has recieved it. While his knowledge for the unit is growing, he still just barely passes his Standards of Learning test with a 401. Over the summer, his school required all students to make up their own project about anything they may have learned. At first he did not think it was going to help him but he decides to give it a try anyway. Generic_Name decides that if he has to learn about something over summer, he might as well learn about something he's been having trouble with.

D5FDDB4DFA82,"Conclusion.When a student is assigned a summer project, their immediate thoughts are almost always negative. This comes with the fact that they do not want to do work over their break, as this is one of the few times out of the year that they're allowed to forget about school for just one moment. Adding to this, if the student is given a teacher-designed project, this puts the motivation to do said project even lower than before. They know that they have no control over how their project turns out, as they often revolve around a fairly black-and-white rubric, resulting in a lack of diversity and creativity between each individual's project.

World War II had just been in Europe, but was now over. Many comturies were left in ruins. These contries needed animals and livestock to survive. The UNRRA hired seagoing cowboys to take care of the livestock on the boats when they were being shipped to a certain part of the world to another. Luke and his friend wanted to care and help, so they signed up for seagoing cowboys program.

Luke had turned 18 upon the first trip, which meant he could be drafted for the army. His draft amnagement company had learned he was in the seagoing cowboys, and they told him to keep doing what he was doing, because it was a form of help.

Sometimesthe weather was bad upon the boats, and sometimes it was good. When it was bad, members upon the boat would participate in watching the storms. One night Luke had watch, he got into a bad accident that left him without work for a couple days due to broken ribs. When the weather was good, and all the chores were done for the day, the men upon the ship had time to play games or travel to see things. The animals are what kept Luke busy though.

D85690C1836A,"Conclusion.Venus is a planet in our solar system and is the second planet from our sun and occasionally the closest in distance too Earth, Venus, and Mars , in this palnet the scientist can't explore this planet because is so far away from the Heart , and this have some differences, for example; one of these is the speed mean that sometimes we are closer too mars and other times to Venus.

Venus maybe this issue explains why or not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades, scientist said that the atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus, also this planet has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerul earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

We know that Venus is a planet in our solar system but that we really don't know and scientist wants to know is know about if in that planet probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, human wants to conquer some of those planets to live in the future, that's the reason why the scientist are discussing about that, or if the rich peolpe can build some skyscraper or some building for rich people go to travel in Venus.

NASA is working to know more about Venus, another example is if the electricity can works there, or how we can get it,

Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, more importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientist seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks.

Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has values, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. ",3,1,356

DA0FBE6F11C9,Conclusion.The projects assigned to the students during the summer should be designed by teachers ,5,2,15
DA0FBE6F11C9,"Conclusion.
Every year many teachers have lesson plans that they go by to get their students to the requirements needed to pass their class. When a teacher assigns a project during the summer it is to prepare the student for the upcoming year. A teacher designs the project in a certain way where the student can obtain information during the summer instead of forgetting it completely. For example, a history teacher assigns a summer project every year. He assigns it so his students can be prepared for the first lesson that he is going to go over. He wants his students to have background information about the material for better understanding. The project could actually be very helpful because instead of going into the class not knowing anything at all a student can at leastÂ go with the information he or she learned from doing the summer project ",3,2,148
DA3D494E63E4,Conclusion.NASA should stop taking photos of the face because they already have enough pictures of the face to look at. In 1976 the took a photo of the face by using Viking 1. Nasa argues that they can get better views when take new photos. critics argue that you dont need that much of photos to figure out what the face is. In 2001 they used the Viking to take a photo of the face and they got back a good photo. ,3,0,83

DABEF78A3A24,"Conclusion.Venus has features such as mountains, craters, and even valleys that are also seen on Earth. According to the article, its atmosphere is 97% carbon dioxide with temperatures averging 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than Earth with can crush nearly anything that tries to reach its surface and even liquefy metals. The second paragraph discussed how spacecrafts in the past barely lasted a few hours and since there hasn't been a spacecraft sent there in more than three decades. This evidence shows that despite the success of reaching Venus, we are not even close to even slowly progressing and fixing smaller issues with spacecrafts traveling there and back to Earth. ",3,2,115
DABEF78A3A24,"Conclusion.Conducting research requires numerous forms of evidence, samples, test, etc. In paragraph 5, the author makes suggestions of creating a spacecraft to sustain temperatures of at least 170 degrees Fahrenheit and levitating thirty-plus miles over the surface to observe the planet. Although this may be the most safest and efficient approach, he even stated that it would require getting ""up close and personal"" to collect samples. The whole idea is to reach Venus and collect data to compare to Earth and Venus' previous history. ",3,2,85

DCABFA6AD5AE,"Conclusion.Summers can be the best times of a students life. They get a break from the stress and anxiety of school and they are allowed to do any and all things they wish to do within the legal limits. Summer projects are designed to keep students engaged and learning. This can be a very good thing as long as the project is based on a topic that the student actually enjoys and will be motivated to complete. Students struggle staying engaged enough during the school year, adding a project during the time they are meant to go be kids should be handled very carefully. ",4,2,105

You can look at the news or on the internet and see just how many young adults' lives are cut short because they wanted to text someone back or make a snap, all of that can wait. Seeing the statistics, the death rates, even some people's friends dead because they couldn't wait to text someone back or make a snap. Just because you got away with it once doesn't mean you should keep trying to do it because all it takes is a couple seconds and then you or someone else is hurt or dead.

DF4E1B5910B6,"Conclusion.NASA has a compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. A blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rolling Venusian landscape. However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground.

To meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. ",3,1,126

Paris bans driving due to smog . As also mentioned the importance of car is no longer such an immediate thought to people more recently.Â  Elisabeth Rosenthal solidifies this in the article

The End of Car Culture when she includes ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" This clear and simple states that people are not considering their cars as such an extreme item and more considering it as a means of transportation only when absolutely necessary such as when ""Bay Area Rapid Transit doesn't work."" As well costs not only personally so much as federally are being affected dramatically. Elisabeth Rosenthal author of In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars explains ""In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.""

While some may argue that challenging work actually causes students to be less inclined to do summer projects, it actually motivates them more. Statistics show that students who are challenged receive better grades than those who are not. If students were to organize a summer project, they would more than likely leave out any form of a challenge, students would much rather have free time than work on a summer project and that would lead to students designing an easy summer project that requires little effort. Teachers on the other hand, give students lots of work so they can gain the information in a much better way. Summer projects aren't made to take up all your free time, they are made to make sure the information that was being taught during school actually stuck and that students fully understand it. Teachers who challenge their students are the teachers with the highest passing scores.

The able to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is also valuble because if a student is struggling with mental problems, rather than being bored or confused, the FACS can detect what he or she is feeling and that particular student can get the help he or she needs to succeed in life.

E5856BB0C34A,"Conclusion.When,

NASA unveiled the image for all to see, the caption noted a ""huge rock formation, which resembles a human head, formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.

Though, When Mars Global Surveryor flew over the Cydonia for the first time, Michael and his Mars Obiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all

EA441360E42C,"Conclusion.Many students love coming home right when the school bell rings and having the rest of the day to do what they like. This is not the case at some schools. At my school our principal is having us participate in one extracurricular activity. I disagree with this because students need time to play and practice sports such as basketball, baseball, hockey, and soccer. Students also need time to hang out with their friends not just inside of school, but outside too. If a student is forced to stay after-school and there is nothing they like there than it may bother the students emotions and make them sad. If a student is sad or upset about this it may affect their participation, attendence, and effort. I do not want kids spending more time than they have to at school. ",3,0,140
EA441360E42C,"Conclusion.Did you know that teachers assign kids with loads of homework? If you didn't then now you do. Here at my school I get home and it takes me a couple of hours to get my homework done. I was very disappointed when I was told that every student has to take part in one extracurricular activity. If this time is taken away from students it will take away time for them to do their homework. If kids start not having time to do their homework their grades may drop, which could make them depressed, and it could affect their behavior at school. If a students grade drops their parents may get mad which would make them sad and upset which could lead to them doing something hurtful or bad to themselves. It could also affect their behavior at school by making them not pay attention and start getting into mischief. If students have to stay after-school for an extra activity, it takes away time for homework which kids need to do and if they dont have the time bad things may happen. ",3,2,184
EA441360E42C,"Concluding Statement.I believe that students should not be forced to participate in one extracurricular activity at school because they need time for other activities outside of school, time to spend with their families, and time to do their homework.

EB763115B6CD,"Conclusion.You can have criminal penalties placed on you such as fines and tickets and depending on if you had an accident and killed someone you may face more serious criminal consequences such as jail time. Driving with a device can cause you to have higher insurance premiums because insurance rates are tied to a driver's driving history and if you get pulled over for using your phone while driving too many times, it could cause your insurance premiums to spike. Also, you can lose your driving privileges because just like your insurance, you accumulate points for your recklessness. So, if you accumulate too many, you can no longer drive.

She ended up loving the sport, and she also plays it to this day. There are many different activities, such as theater, art, sports, science and math clubs, and the student council. Students are most likely going to find an activity they like and stick with it as they get older. Doing an activity that you enjoy can be very entertaining, and you might keep doing it in the future. I am in my school's eighth grade chorus, and I want to continue this activity as I get into high school. If you really enjoy these activities at school, you might also try to practice them at home. If you like to go to an art club at your school, you might continue to draw at home. These activities can also lead to trying to improve in your hobby as well.

F065FD9F8D5F,"Conclusion.When I learned vital concepts such as multiplication, the way my teacher taught was through constant out loudÂ repetition of the material, which helped my classmates along, but not me. I needed to see the problem worked out and look at the numbers because I had trouble picturing all the math and numbers in my head. Not being able to understand that basic concept of multiplication was detrimental to my math abilities and led the following years of my math career to be absolutely exhausting. This same scenario could take place involving summer projects. A teacher could give a student a summer assignment to help them learn about a concept in that class, but if the design of the assignment was difficult for the student to understand, it could be more hurtful than helpful. The entire reason teachers and schools assign projects over the summer is to assure that students will continue to learn during their break, but how are the students supposed to learn if they can't understand or have trouble with the assignment?

Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of growing trend in europe. The United States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called ""smart planning"" stated in paragraph 4. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up 50% in some car intensive areas in the United States. When you don't have a car you had to walk to get where you need to go. But when you get a car you dont think about walking because all you wanna do is drive.

In paris on Mondays motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22 euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd numbered plates the following day. Keeping the air clear is very important. 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to fine. Car traffic was down 6o percent in the capital of France, after 5 days of intensifying smog.

F3580A6BAFA8,"Conclusion.they're always tense, not using a car makes them happier, as stated by Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two (Source 1). The stress aspect of this could be due to the fact that in the most recent years, the percentage of car crashes and accidents have gone up. Many people abhor the idea of using cars because they have been in an terible accident themselves or someone close to them. Also, it can even just be all the traffic jams that occur during rush hour, which makes people late and accidents do happen. For example in Bogota, Colombia, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to their designated location, to leave the streets due to traffic jams (Source 3). Since they knew that lots of their citizens were deciding not to use cars they started making uneven, pitted sidewalks into nice, smooth, replaced ones for them (Source 3). ",3,2,154

Not only is it important for that summer project but those time management skills carry over into the coming school year. A project that is designed by a student may not properly prepare you for the rigor of the curriculum that is to come or the amount of time that is necessary for the class. A teacher creating a project will be able to demonstrate how much time the student will need to put in for their class in the upcoming year. If a student is able to manage their time well during the summer months when there is always something better to do then they will be able to manage all of their classes and those course loads better. They will have a better idea of what they need to do to succeed in the next school year.

In the past the summer assignments that I have been given have not been too difficult and I never really minded doing them. The teacher is the one who teaches the class and if they expect us to have prior knowledge of the class then they should be the ones designing it. It is not going to be harmful and there is plenty of time over the summer for it to be completed so I do believe that a project designed by teacher over the summer is more beneficialÂ then one that would be designed by a student.Â  ",1,2,134

F634BC92DC39,"Conclusion.Looking down at a cell phone for 5 sec while going just 55 mph means that you have just crossed the length of an entire football field without looking up at the road. The AAA Foundation For Traffic Safety ranked using a hands-free mobile device as a level 2 distraction and texting while operating a vehicle as a level 3 distraction, the highest level. Such distractions are unacceptable when operating a motor vehicle, it could lead to injuries or worse. A study conducted by Cambridge Mobile Telematics revealed that roughly 52% of drives that resulted in a crash were caused by distracted driving, and roughly eleven teens die per day as a result of texting and driving. Inexperienced drivers, such as teens, are more prone to engage in distracted driving, and are more likely to suffer a crash or accident when engaging in distracted driving.

F647D77D7396,"Conclusion.During school holidays, teachers are unable to assign work or projects to students because their breaks are dedicated to leaving ones mind at rest. Though students are unable to receive work over short-term breaks, work over the summer is optional for most teachers. While a break from constant learning is needed for the mind to repair itself, stopping all academic thought can effect the students recovery back into their new school term.

F7561C027920,"Conclusion.In high school, summer projects (especially for advanced placement classes) are assignments that students must complete. There is no way to get out from completing those assignments. Teachers create most of these summer projects because they know exactly what the students should learn before they reach the first class of the year.

They examined the affect of fifty college students attitudes and mood throughout one month, with twenty-five of them doing an activity unrelated to school, and the other twenty-five who didn't participate in an extracurricular activity. After a month of research and testing, the professors at the univerisity got their results. It was proven that the students that did do something unrelated to schoolwork, were much happier, had higher levels of dopamine, good grades, and were able to fuction through their daily lives with barely any obstacles or problems. However, the students that didn't participate in anything had lower levels of dopamine and were a lot more stressed out. Then, because of this, their grades were affected drastically. Doing an activity like track or joining a club would be better for a students mental health. ",3,2,149

F8C22ACD1774,"Conclusion.A psychology teacher conducts a final exam each year in the form of a project in which students choose a topic and are not given instructions besides to relate it to psychology; consequently, she has found this project to be a hassle more than an excitement for both her and some of her students. ",3,2,55
F8C22ACD1774,"Conclusion.Many students would jump at the opportunity to get ahead on the information for the next school year and many may not enjoy the requirement, but appreciate the opportunity.

Giving clear instructions provides the structure to learn and get ahead before the race for grades begins.

A summer project in which the students are designing and planning does not insure they will continue to learn during their break, but instead assures teachers that students will attempt to make it as non complexÂ and superficial for themselves as possible.

Providing students with the opportunity to design their project uniquelyÂ with no specifications needed enables them to be lazy in the creation of the project and miss critical information for the subject that the project is on.

Students come up with many ways to avoid in depth descriptions of a topic because of the lack of motivation to do so.

With clear instructions, students will be able to find the information the teacher wants and needs in order to grade the project, and the information needed to elaborate on this knowledge in the beginning of the school year.

Students want the ability to enjoy the summer and with the specific necessities for the summer project highlighted, they will not have the stress of creating a project from scratch. ",3,2,217

Students would be choosing their own work, allowing them to more blatantly show their own ability through more preffered methods.

To extend on this, students would create better designed projects as they wouldn't feel pressured to follow an exact guideline to receive a high-scoring grade.Â Student-designed projects would allow more room for students to seek different opportunities to express themselves through their work.

He first worked at a grocery store and and the bank. When his friend invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. He couldnt say no. So then he went.

He had graduated from high school and had 2 jobs but whem his friend invited him to Europe his whole llife had changed. Since there was a war he went to go help out. He and Don had signed up to be a segoing cowboy. 44 nations joined toggether and formed a UNNRA and he was hired to be a seagoing cowboy. That when you have to take care of horses , mules adnd young cows. That was his job over there in Europe.

He kept going there and he kept helping others. He like his job. The cattle boats were unbelievable for a small town boy it had said. He really enjoyed his job. He toured lots of places like Venice Italy and a city with streets of water. But Luke had made 9 trpis the most of any seagoing cowboy.

FD562A12092E,"Conclusion.Students, after a tiring school year, want to relax during their summer break. By allowing students to design the project, they will create it in an uncaring way in order to get it over with. Students will not put the effort in both designing and finishing the project. This will create no benefit, growth, or thought in their education and academics. A personal example revolves around a project my English teacher once gave out. There was no prompt and no requirements other than a works cited. This created a hard time for students to figure out what they needed to do. As seen by this example, allowing students to design their own projects will create no benefit or direction. Without the direction of a teacher, students will not know what or how to do anything that is needed of them. ",3,2,141

FF7AFA7FF8B6,"Conclusion.I wanted to inform you that there is a limit for driving a car there has been some changes during this few years. Its not only in America that is going on its in other cities and also in states, where people have been droping there adavantages to drive around and dicide to walk instead or to ride a bus to get to other places, they also do that to save money for the gasoline especially if they drive long distance. For example in German Suburb they have forbidden street parking, driveways and home garages, new district on outskirts of freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. There's a place called Vauban's and its a total Car-free, 70% of vaubans don't own a car and 57% sold thier car to move here. In Paris, they have banded driving due to smog, can ya'll believe that?;they have done because after days of near pollution paris inforced partial driving to clean the air of global city. people that drived with a even-numbered license plate they were charged a 31 dollars fine almost 4,000 drivers were fine according to Reuters. Now the ""smog"" came from Beijing,China which is one of the most polluted city in the world.

Paris typically has more smog then other European capitals, but eventually the smog cleared enough for The Ruling French party. There's was also a Car-Free day in Bogata and it was a big hit, Colombians usually hiked,biked,skated or even took buses to work during the car-free day if you left early people avoid traffic jams. and there goal is to promte alternative transportation and reduce smog it was a good ways to take way stress and lower air pollution. there's parks and sports centers that have bloomed throughout the city; uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad,rush-hours have dramatically cut traffic. The End of Car Culture, where president Obama ambitious goal to curb the United States greenhouse gas emission,unveiled last week. Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less, but also getting fewer licenses as years go by. theres a question that says 'Has America passed peak driving?""i mean am not sure how to explan ,but am sure america ids the the same as it use to be and now that they are talking or writing a articule about it means that alot of people are driving less and buying cars. A study has shown that young people decreased 23% between 2001 and 2009.    ",3,1,418
FF9684AB0131,"Conclusion.An example for this is when the text states,""Venus is the closest planet to the Earth in terms of density and size."" ",3,0,25
FFF868E06176,"Conclusion.Teachers can overstep because it may not seem like a lot of work to them, but to the students, it is.

00066EA9880D,Conclusion.Driverless cars are exaclty what you would expect them to be. Cars that will drive without a person actually behind the wheel controlling the actions of the vehicle. The idea of driverless cars going in to developement shows the amount of technological increase that the wolrd has made. The leader of this idea of driverless cars are the automobiles they call Google cars. The arduous task of creating safe driverless cars has not been fully mastered yet. ,4,0,78
00066EA9880D,Conclusion.This is such a dangerous thing because we all know that whenever humans get their attention drawn in on something interesting it is hard to draw their focus somewhere else. The article explains that companies are trying to implement vibrations when the car is in trouble. Their are some people out there who do not feel vibrations and therefore would not be able to take control of the car when needed. The article also states that companies are trying to put in-car entertainment into the car while it is being driven. This is just another thing that will distract the person who is supposed to be ready at all times to take over driving when asked to do so. ,3,2,120

01B3A57AB13D,"Conclusion.Firstly, the primary reasons why schools get canceled and have to plan extra days within the school year is because of the fear of dangerous weather conditions that threatens the safety of the student body. ",0,2,36
01B3A57AB13D,Conclusion.Another external issue that can cause harm or cancel school for students is when schools are under reconstruction which creates distractions and hazardous areas within the school that can threaten the safety of the student body. ,0,2,37
01B3A57AB13D,"Conclusion.School expenses would overall be reduced if students are able to attendÂ online classes because some students face the unfortunate circumstance of not having a school bus assigned to their specific neighborhood which means that their parents' car mileage and car fuel are being rapidly used up in order for them to have a source of transportation to school. Online classes, in contrast, would simply require students to walk to a quiet environmentÂ within their home to ensure that they can maintain a focused mindset that is ready to learn through either reading an online textbook or participating in a video conference. Another expense when attending a physical school are the school lunches which are priced from one to five dollarsÂ depending on the county or school system and can accumulate to an enormous amount of money for middle class students who eat school lunches everyday. Distance learning, on the other hand, would allow students the ability to eat at home without the need for their parents to pay additional fees and students with a variety of health issues or allergies can also control the ingredients of the foods they are consuming to ensure that they are not deteriorating their health. ",3,2,202
01B3A57AB13D,Conclusion.Private and public schools are forcing their students into a regime and strictÂ schedule that takes up the majority of the mornings and afternoons of their students' life which disables them the ability to apply for internships or well paying part time jobs that occur during typical school hours. Online classes would allow students the ability to choose the time for their classes which forces students to practice prioritizing responsibilities and improve on their time managementÂ skill. An example of students who mostly work while attending school are college students who have to pay for their attendance and possibly even lodging within the college campus. Virtual classrooms would allow these students to build their work portfolio while also allowing students to return home after work and finish their academic assignments at home during nighttime.Â Another reason as to why online courses' flexible scheduleÂ is beneficial for students is because they would be able to have enough time during daylight hours to volunteer and help give back to their community which builds the morals and social connections with others in the community while also allowing the students to formally engage in academic studies at home after they've finished volunteering. Students would greatly benefit from online classes where a flexible schedule will allow students to have more time to engage in different experiences in life and formulate a more balanced lifestyle that isn't fully revolved around academics. ,3,2,236
01B3A57AB13D,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion, distance learning is beneficial for students where it ensures that the students' education isn'tÂ hindered by uncontrollable weather conditions and it helps ease financial stress that low income and middle class families experience in a capitalist society. But most importantly, it allows students to have more independence which builds their character and further prepares them for the adult world where they are gradually gaining new responsibilities and experiences in life which they wouldn't be capable of experiencing without the flexible schedule that online courses allow. Virtual education is both effective and beneficial for the rising digital youths of America.Â  ",1,2,103

This will cut down on students using class phones, and will help stop texting going on in class. If they believe they have the liberty to text during free times and lunch period, then they will be less likely to text in class. By giving them freedom, you are helping yourself because they are less likely to break the rules if they have something to tell their friends or family and they do not need to break the school rules to tell them really quickly. They would have time to do and say whatever they wanted to friends and family, and that would cut down on students getting in trouble during class.

Source 3: In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president

; they give us ""

five reasons for retaining the Electoral College

"" ( Richard A. Posner ). The first reason is ""

Certainty of Outcome

"" which goes on to say that; ""

... almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state makes a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state.

"", ( Richard A. Posner ). The second reason is ""

Everyone's President

"" that states that; ""

The Electoral College requires a presidential canidate to have trans-regional appeal.

"", ( Richard A. Posner ). ""

Swing States

"" is the third reason, talks about Toss-up States. The fourth reason is ""

Big States

"" which sates ""

that the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance...

"" ( Richard A. Posner ). The fifth and final reason is ""

Avoid Run-Off Elections

"", it says that ""

... no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast.

05BE83E193CF,Conclusion.The electoral college is a great way of proceeding with elections because changing the way our election system is to one of popularity voting would not be wise because voters may not believe in what the candidate's intentions are for the people but they may like the candidate ,0,0,49
05BE83E193CF,Conclusion.However the popular vote election may also be a good idea because if the voters cast a vote for you in theÂ  popular election that should essentially like your intentions that would benefit the countries needs and demands that are recquired for us in the long run ,2,0,48
05BE83E193CF,"Concluding Statement.Therefore the electoral college should stay in charge of all decsions having to do with the elections for new presidencey when the time time comes because if it was changed to popular vote people would vote for the candidate that they like the best instead of the candidate with the best intentions for the nation, it is considerably more organized than a popular vote election , and the people would be end up being pleased with the outcome in the long run.

0640FE8DF9D6,"Conclusion.Instead of students worrying about what work they're missing on their sick days they can open up their device and do the work from home. This same practice could also be used in scenarios such as snow days,tornadoes,floods or other bad weather that causes schools to shut down. This could also be the new way to combat schools having to add more school days to make up for the missed ones.

0640FE8DF9D6,"Conclusion.As great as distance learning sounds it, as with all decisions, does notÂ come without drawbacks. Tackling possibly it's biggest problem, distance learning has a high technological dependency to function efficiently and having tech means spending lots of money.

0640FE8DF9D6,"Concluding Statement.Distance learning is a relatively new method on how people get their education. No matter the outside conditions, distance learning can still give students their assignments for the day. This idea in other countries has proven to go beyond and into remote places and provide education to places without schools. Even with the limitations is has now, I'm sure that the use of it will most likely spread in the future. I believe that within some years that distance learning could be a practical way to do school; in fact, it could even be the primary way to attend school. ",1,2,102
06A2C91F38FE,Conclusion.After researching the Electoral College process I find that the process should no longer be used. The process is not effecient for choosing the next US president and therefor the voting process should be changed to popular vote. ,5,2,39
06A2C91F38FE,"Conclusion.This makes the Electoral College not a democratic method for electing the president. This nation was founded on the belief of democracy, so when the government ignores the call for a democratic method for elections it is disrespectful towards out Founding Fathers, and especially to the citizens of the United States of America. Furthermore, state representatives may misrepresent a state, possibly by defiance. This has happened in the 2000 campaign where segregationalists defied the people and nearly succeeded in replacing the electors for those who opposed Josh F. Kennedy. ",3,2,90

But if you don't want to hear it then that's ok with me and that walking on the green going to connections please give us a break that's why boys cut up all the time because you always say walk on the green it is making us cut up like that since Elementary school we didn't have to walk on the green but now we are in middle school we have to walk on the green, i mean come on TEACHER_NAME can you just at least give this school a break and don't you get me started on boys not pulling up there pants, as RELATIVE_NAME says on RELATIVE_NAME's big happy family pants on the ground got your pants on the ground looking like a fool with your pants on the ground can't turn around with the gold in your mouth RELATIVE_NAME remix what.

07397A3E9D8D,"Conclusion.If a student were to work from home, they would choose when they want to work and if they even feel like doing assignments that day. Having this scheduleÂ teaches them time management which helps them develop the technique for the future when planning out different things. My friend, Generic_Name, has a very hard time planning things such as hanging out with friends, when to complete assignments, etc. She learned how to manage a schedule that incorporates all of her needs and wants into her day. She is able to attend school, go to soccer practice, and still have time for her friends and family. This is one of many life lessons that attending school can give you. When people think of school they think of all the work they have to complete with no time in the day to do it. By developing this schedule it helps them manage their priorities first and helps them incorporate their wants as well. ",3,2,162
0741F0C1D776,"Conclusion.While online learning may be a good fix for a lot of these issues it could open up new problems as well.

076DBAE9AA98,Conclusion.I have written this letter to inform you that you do not have to cancel all school sports. I think that you don't need to cancel it for all student. I think that you should have the audacity to tell everyone that the sports will not be able to be played by students that have anything below an A-C average. ,5,0,61
076DBAE9AA98,"Conclusion.All student with an A, B, or a C average can play any sport they wanted to but every marking period they should have to show the coach's their progress report. ",0,2,32
076DBAE9AA98,Conclusion.All students should have a sport to keep them active for a while and not get distracted by any thing like walking around the class. ,0,0,26
076DBAE9AA98,Conclusion.Students should not be all closed up with nothing to do they should at least have an hour of fun in their school day at least twice a week there should be 2-3 hours of out side time to let their energy all out of their systems. ,0,2,48

So it a accident now. Like it says in the passage""this means human drivers must remain alert and be readdy to takke over when the situation requires. You cant take over if your busy on your phone or eating food or doing something you wouldnt do if you was driving. So thats the down part. ",3,0,92
07C19143568C,Conclusion.I think the electoral college should stay ,5,0,8
07C19143568C,"Conclusion.If u havent notice i have said yes they should be hear to do there job as a elector and to do there job as a guy/girl to do there jobs rights. I understand why elector are trying to stay there trying to stay to have a sucessful carrer and do good in life and not be a bum that live on the street or working at mcdonalds. Another good reason is that if it turn into a tie then the house or representatives come into place and they put the thoughts into. A reason to be it unfair the electoral collehe get no credit for what happens they should get alittle for all the hard work they put into. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for president, but for a slate of electors, who turn elect the president. Who are the elector? They can be anyone not holding public office.

07C6107B301F,"Conclusion.there are many jobs out there that require people with an education, while as there are very few jobs that require you to be good at sports. In this world, education will get you far and having a C average isn't going to cut it. 
",3,2,46
07C6107B301F,"Concluding Statement.. I strongly recommend that you enforce this rule. Just watch the events unfold when you enforce it. There grades will rise and eventually they will be accustomed to all the hard work they put in. Education is everything and will shape your life, while sports is just an extracurricular activity that might or might not get you an Athletic scholarship. ",1,2,62
07D075719A6D,"Conclusion.The Electoral College only consists of qualified citizens it elect the President, so even when you vote the majority doesn't even matter because the President is only elected by those qualified citizens. ",0,1,33
07D0B701C682,"Conclusion.Maybe they were tryin to send a sign, if they were trying to send a sign why couldn't they have just come to earth and tell us what we need to know. What was the point of going to Mars no one lives on Mars we live on Earth. ",3,1,50
07E503B34962,Conclusion.The main reason i believe that we should support the idea of community service is because it shows responsibility and respect for the community we live in. ,0,0,28

0825571D1A47,Conclusion.Imagine being in a hallway with what seems like a million new faces every day and you are not familiar with anyone. Making friends is hard when you have anxiety because the most comfortable place is yourself. ,0,2,38
0825571D1A47,"Conclusion.A student with anxiety can be taking a test that is very challenging and tediousÂ and the walls will seem as if they are beginning to shrink and close that student in. That is anxiety, anxiety is going over a whole conversation and going over what you will say so you dont mess up. Anxiety is scary. As you can imagine, school with 2000 kids everyday can be difficult for students. Working to overcome your anxiety can take a long time and is necessary but better results will be achieved when the student makes the decision for themselvesÂ to take classes at school rather than home because some kids just arent ready for that yet. ",3,2,116
0825571D1A47,Conclusion.The 504 plan is a plan that was made to accommodate and assist students with learning disabilities. This plan works by giving students more time to complete assignments and giving students accommodations to put them in a learning environment that will benefit them ,0,2,44
0825571D1A47,Concluding Statement.Students taking classes online will be very beneficial. My overall reasoning behind this is a lotÂ of the problems that students face is because of the students and the teachers in the building. Online education eliminated those factors. Students distractions will be limited. The environment will be safer. It is sometimes necessary for students to take online classes at home therefore it should always be an option. The big picture is to make our next leading generation more educated than the last. Whatever makes that easier should be employed into our school systems.Â  ,1,2,95
082598CC8955,Concluding Statement.it is ok for us to have are phones out like a lunch or on are free time. ,1,0,20
083C3AE77587,Conclusion.My third and final reason is with the electoral voting system there is actually a chance of tying. ,0,0,19
083C3AE77587,Conclusion.if they tye what do you do now? Should we flip a coin to see who wins possibly one of the most important descisons ,3,1,25
085CACF9DE2B,Conclusion.The first and most obvious reason is safety. ,0,2,9
085CACF9DE2B,"Conclusion.And finally, a third reason we do not need driverless cars in this day and age, is people would forget how to drive a regular car or neglect to even learn if the car drove itself. ",0,2,37
085CACF9DE2B,"Conclusion.In addition, driverless cars would be at an increased risk for technolgical malfunctions causing potentially fatal crashes. As of right now, the technology in driverless cars is only experimental and theoretical. It would take many years to iron out all the bugs, so to speak, to make these cars function properly all the time. As mentioned paragrpah nine of the article, in most of the Unites States, it is illegal to test drive driverless cars. It is illegal for these very reasons. It is illegal because experimenting with that kind of technology is dangerous.

085CACF9DE2B,Conclusion.A second reason that driverless cars are not necessary is the unimaginable cost it would be to manufacture these cars. ,0,2,21
0878DADF1B3C,Conclusion.I firmly believe that we should keep the Electoral College. ,5,0,11
0878DADF1B3C,"Conclusion.Many people say that it is ""outdated, irrational, and unfair"" ",2,0,11
088C3E8EBAE7,"Conclusion.I understand the ""wrong"" part of it like in the 2nd source it says ""If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Karry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry."" meanning voters vote for a slate of electors and they choose the president. ",2,2,55
088C3E8EBAE7,"Conclusion.There is also number 4 where the Electoral College ""restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution"" ",3,2,34
088C3E8EBAE7,Concluding Statement.In summation im in favor with the Electoral College for many reasons. After reading through this side and the opponing side of the argument I can honestly say that I prefer this method as it is. Yes there is a bad side to it but there is a bad side to everything and it shouldn't be big enough for anyone to oppose it. ,1,2,65
08BE7B30414F,Conclusion.I agree with Bob Dole about abolishing the Electoral College ,5,0,11
08BE7B30414F,Conclusion.The Electoral College is unfair to the voters. It's called the diaster factor for a reason. ,0,0,17
08BE7B30414F,"Conclusion.The American people should be able to vote for who they want. It states that when a person votes you are clearly voting for a slate of electors not the president himself. The Winner-take-all system in each state, candidiates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning,focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. It is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. ",3,0,117
08BE7B30414F,"Conclusion.No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. Residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised- to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president. ",0,0,46
08BE7B30414F,"Conclusion.Should residents of another region feel like their votes do not count? No, they shouldn't each vote should be counted in order for the president to get into The White House. The president is their president as well as mine and yours and they shouldn't have to feel as if he wasn't and wouldn't want to know what their interest were. They should be treated equally. ",3,0,67

091315F8E9A9,"Conclusion.such as the unfairness to voters, the disasters awaiting to happen with the Electoral College. The only downside to this is that it will take a little longer to count the votes and finalize the election, but it is worth it. All voters would be at peace of mind knowing that their vote actually counted for something. ",3,1,58
091375884D88,"Conclusion.The electoral college process has the govenor prepare a ""Certificate of ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of the respective electors. the certificate also declares the winner of the election so people arent even aloud to have a say in the voting process. ""during the 2000 campaign seventeen states didnt even see the candidates at all, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad."" ",3,0,86

09281EFF7A66,"Conclusion.Voters dont vote for a president,But for a state elector. The disaster factor is the best argument against the electoral college. The electoral college is irrational,outdated and unfair, And the arguments have pros that are assertions without basis in reality. The Electoral college is not democratic in a modern sense. The electoral college is also a anachronism. ",3,0,60

0969066E81F6,"Conclusion.Some people should consider themselves lucky because of what happened in 2000 with that fiasco and it was the biggest election crisis in a century. Even though there is 270 votes required to vote for the president, whats fun about that is because there be moreÂ  votes and atleast people participate in them. Choosing our president is best because when your voting for the president your voting for state electors ",3,1,71

0A6F7ECC5B8F,"Conclusion.The article ""The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong' ,by Bradford Plumer it quoted ,Back in 1960,segregationists in the Louisana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose Jhon F. Kennedy.(So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy).The election whould have gone the other way if the due to the electoral college. The electoral college are way too risky to take on. just simply couple of unwilling electors can change the tide of the election. ",3,2,98
0AA8E5C89F0F,Conclusion.I believe that community service should be a completely voluntary thing. But i do think that you should initiate a school wide punishment for those caught littering on campus. ,5,2,30
0AC09FD13E72,"Conclusion.Like think about it if one of the big states for example lets say Texas wants to vote for canidate but two smaller states want to vote for another canidate but they don't have enough votes to compete with that one big state then the bigger states would always wn the elections and that dosnt make the elections fair like thet should be and that just makes it worse that ""it is"" now beacuse with the electoral college it makes the voting fair because they can see the what all the states want and they can choose who is right for the poisition. People might have other opinions and that is completley fine but at the end of the day a disision has to made and it would be best if it was the best desision for the people being made. ",3,0,142

0B2C0C1833BF,Conclusion.TO volatier they have to wear old cloths. they have a seartan time for them to be done. if they are bord at home they can ask the people to do more work with the community service. the people will tell them what ever they want. then the volienters will go home or stay there ware they are at. ,3,1,60
0B30792F314D,"Conclusion.That is an issue but also some people voting don't really understand what the two people are offering and just vote because one sounds better, looks cooler, your friends are voting for him/her. This is why the popular voting system cannot be fully trusted. 
",0,1,45
0B30792F314D,Concluding Statement.In conclusion both system are great together but apart cannot funcion. The founding fathers and leaders of this country cannot be blamed for making this system because there is really no way to make it fair and they did their best to do so.

The electoral college is not based on equality because everybodys votes count differently due to supporters or electors who are pretty much the ones getting the votes. fixing the way people vote and how they vote can change the way some people feel towards the preident no matter who they are.

Under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors. The single best argument agianst the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The election would be thrown to the house or Representatives, where state delegations vote to the presdient. Because each state casts only one vote to give th voters vote to the president and another for the congress,

The House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the wall of the people, And if an electoral tie seems unlikely. A the base level the electoral colloege is unfair to voters.

After Al Gore won the presidental election in 2000 due to the popular vote of the people, The thing best known as the diaster factor came into play. The disaster factor is a fiasco that happens in the American goverment. This happened because according to the law state legislaters are techically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. In 1960 this happened to then Vice President(also running for the big chair) Nixon. The state corresponders for Hawaii overthrew Nixons oppents electors votes in order for him to win. He cheated to win. He bribed the electors because lets be real who is gonna turn down 50,000 dollars? Its the electors fault that bad leadership comes to America. ",3,1,151

For example, when students are requested to give money for a charitable cause, such as helping the less fortunate in third world countries, they choose not to. The sad part is that this refusal to help others in need is not because they are uninformed, but because they are so caught in themselves that they are too selfish to even provide for someone other than themselves.

18AC57CFB338,"Conclusion.Firstly, the option of online classes would allow students to attend classes despite conditions that would normally prevent them from doing so. ",0,2,23
18AC57CFB338,"Conclusion.For example, during winter, schools across the nation often close because of hazardous weather conditions that make it too dangerous to travel to school. However, with online classes, students could simply be instructed online, avoiding many missed days of valuable learning. This system would also take pressure off of school systems to keep schools open on days with questionably dangerous weather. Without worrying about missing yet another day of classes, schools could make the safe choice and close on more of these days. Additionally, it is common for students to stay home a few days when sick so that they can recover and avoid infecting their classmates. However, it is often the case that despite the risk of infecting classmates, students are still well enough to participate in class, but are unable to do so. With the option of online classes, these students could still participate without risking infection. A present day example of the possible utility of online classes is the Coronavirus outbreak. Many school systems worldwide have already shut down as a result of the virus. With online classes, these school systems could continue to instruct their students while also decreasing the risk of Coronavirus spreading. Overall, there are many situations in which online classes allow instruction to continue when not normally possible through traditional methods. ",3,2,219
18AC57CFB338,Conclusion.One more significant reason for providing the option of online classes is that they are much more logistically efficient than classes taught in person. ,0,0,25
18AC57CFB338,"Conclusion.Firstly, there is no travel time from home to the school. Additionally, transition time in between classes and time for lunch could be saved as well. This saved time could be put to various good uses. Classes could be lengthened, or another class could be added to students' schedules. Students could also get more sleep in the morning; many teenagers are chronically sleep deprived, so this would be a massive benefit. Students could also use the extra time to get a job. ",3,2,83
18AC57CFB338,"Conclusion.However, the time saved through online classes would actually allow students to spend more time out with friends, which would teach them to get along with other people well. ",6,2,30
18AC57CFB338,"Conclusion.Another benefit is that students could attend distant schools that would not be practical to attend in person. Besides the saved travel time, switching to more online classes would eliminate a great deal of paper waste, as many more assignments and materials would probably be online. This would benefit the environment, and it would keep students from having to keep track of both physical and digital assignments and documents. Finally, school systems could save money on a great deal of physical infrastructure, such as school buildings, classroom materials, and buses. The funds savedÂ could be redirected towards giving students computers, paying teachers more, or investing in better learning resources. Overall, the saved time and money from switching to more online classes would significantly benefit students and teachers. ",3,2,128

193FCB88CF06,"Conclusion.There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidental election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state-democrats in Texas, for example,or Republicans in California. Each party selects a slate os electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. The Electoral College is widely regarded as an person or thing in the past that cannot fit in the present.

1C088E6CD17E,"Conclusion.The whole purpose of providing the youth with education is to be able to train them to become independent enough to be self-sufficient in the real world. In a school or classroom environment, they learn valuable teamwork skills that allow them to cooperate and collaborate with other individuals about how to approach an issue, overcome challenges, and propose a solution. This eventually leads to the building of bonds and relationships that could impact an individual's life or mental health, whereas online schooling encourages the opposite effect of this. By physically going to school, these individuals nurture their abilities to be problem-solvers and natural thinkers. Additionally, some students may not take online classes seriously as opposed to physically showing up for class. For an example, online students may not require a time constraint and does not require the students to be properly dressed for the ""class."" Sometimes, the individual may present themselves to an online class in their pajamas because they woke up an hour ago. This does not exemplify sophistication nor does the class seem respected. On the other hand, if the student were to show up to school, they would look much more prepared and willing to learn. This highlights the difference between individuals who value their education and the ones who do not. ",3,2,217

1CCDBD707F65,"Concluding Statement.To sum it all up, the Electoral college is just an unnecassary back up plan when there is not one needed. It is unfair to the citizens and the candidate's electors are unreliable. If there was a way to keep the Electoral College, it would only be for ties. It wouldnt be needed if the vote was a clean win. When the President Election comes in the next 3 years, I hope that you consider my thoughts, because there are plenty people out there with the same perspective.    ",1,2,90
1CD84A125450,"Conclusion.The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as compromise between election of President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of a qualified citizens. Each candidate running for President has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party. You help choose your state electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your canidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. ",4,1,91

If it was me having that B and working my butt off to get that A for report card and i almost had it but then she wouldn't let me have it because i turned something in late i would be disappointed to see me leave my team in the dust . 
",3,0,95
1D8D04DBA122,Concluding Statement.So this is why i think we should have a B average to play a sport without out having to worry about getting our grade up. I also can see why she would want to have everyone have an A average because she wants people to have good grades and know that if you don't have the responsibility to keep your grades up then you have to be put off your team because then they would think your not a good student. ,1,0,84

He asked for the answers to the questions on the test and while he was busy typing it out little did he know that the teacher was watching him the whole time. The teacher had to stop everybody that was taking the test and had to figure out who was cheating. After that his phone was token away from him and was in major trouble. Not only was it not worth it to get in trouble for this but it distracted the whole class and academically took away from everybody's experience. Yet another time that someone got in trouble was when my friend decided to send explicit text messages to his girlfriend. Now if that wasn't bad enough he did it during class, when everybody was watching. Now he didn't caught on his end but when the girlfriend received the message someone heard it and said something. The teacher then confiscated the phone and found the messages. She looked at who sent it and reported it to the office. Both people involved were sent to the office and were in major trouble involving parents and everything. This type of behavior would not be uncommon if the cell phone policy was instituted. ",3,2,234

Can we live the way we want to live

? can we live our lives without something happening that changes everything? Most of the time no, there is always something/someone that changes things in our lives.

Students taking classes from home would loose touch with societal standards and become worse adults by not respecting things like: dress codes, rules of the office, or authority figures. This would be because of the lowered interaction with these rules and could lead to people who aren't mentally tough. Students without friends would become lost in society and could be unable to speak about their situation because of their lack of original social interaction.

287CDB5117E0,Conclusion.There are pros and cons for both whywe should keep and get rid of the Electoral college ,5,1,18
287CDB5117E0,"Conclusion.In 2000 Gore had a high percentage of the popular vote than electoral votes. This is so rare that the only other time that it happened was in 1888. Most states give electoral votes on a winner-takes-all basis, some split the votes a little bit, because of this there is a clear winner. In the case of electoral votes, no one region of the United States can win alone, so the votes are spread out. If presidential elections were decided directly by the popular vote than region favorites would be elected abd the rest of the voters would feel that they did'nt vote for the president that was elected. Presidential candidates are most likely to campaign in ""swing states"" that they know they cn win the electoral votes from. Voters in these states are most likely to pay close attention to both candidates, so the most thoughtful voters will get the most representation. The most populated states or the ""big states"" get the most electoral votes, meaning the states with the most people the the most representation. With the Electoral College you increase your chances of having a majority (fifty percent or more). While there can be a tie, this is rare.

I once on a personal note, once had to stay home from school since I had the stomach bug the whole family In my home had, I had to get caught up so I used the Google classroom and electude websites that the teachers say to use at home, just in caseÂ you miss class due to viruses.

294099CEB05C,"Conclusion.By doing this, the students at our school will be smarter and more mature. The student will have to wok very hard to achieve a grade B average and will have to study more.

294CA62F98EC,"Conclusion.Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.""(source 2) which means that they won't visit every state because there is no reason to visit some. ",3,2,51
294CA62F98EC,"Conclusion.If there ever is a deadlock in the campiagn the voting will have to go to the house which will be mostly filled with the majority side. So the minority won' have much of a chance."" Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state."" (source 3) that means a close election isn't so close anymore because of Electoral vote. But some people will say u can never get a tie.

Today we live in a society in which students attend classes on a daily basis, some who walk across the street to attend class, some who have at least an hour commute to attend class everyday, and some who take online courses, which is very beneficial ",4,2,94

2A52459E72AD,"Conclusion.In most cases, online and video conferencing classes from home are beneficial to students because it enables a student who may be ill or disabled a chance to attend a class from their home, which may be a challenge for them if they were to attend it in person ",0,2,50
2A52459E72AD,"Conclusion.Another example of why online and video conferencing classes are beneficial to a student with an illness or disability is illustrated the time my Generic_Name was in college and got an bad spinal and neck injury, allowing her to not be able to walk for months and having to be in a wheel chair. It was very difficult for her to attend her English, Psychology, and AB Calculus classes due to this disability. Her counselor recommended that she stayed home for a few months to recover and continue attending her very important classes via video conference while her professor was teaching. Ultimately, had she not reaped the benefits from attending her classes through video at home, it would have been an enormous task to make it to her classes on a daily basis. In conclusion, online and video conference classes are a huge advantage for students who have trouble attending their classes in person. ",3,2,155
2ABF91C208B8,"Conclusion.I think we should stick with the Electoral College because you vote for your president, vice president, electors, and where the electors meet all at the same time. ",3,0,29
2ABF91C208B8,"Conclusion.I dont believe anybody would be happy because thats not a fair way to choose how our President, Vice president and the Representatives should be picked. We pick a new president every four years so why don't we just keep it the way it been for a long time so we don't mess everybody up on their decisions. Another reaosn why I don't care to switch is because what if we run into a run-off election. If we run into one of those it would be hard to get out of it just because we wouldn't know what to do. Popular vote would also run us into "" swing votes. "" If we were to get stuck in a swing vote, everybody would have to re vote and then pray it dosen't happen again. ",3,0,135
2AC01E3AB211,"Conclusion.Many schools require that all students must attend school, rather than doing an online school, while some schools allow students to chose to do online school. For most students, attending school shouldn't be an issue;however, that is not the case for some students ",4,0,44

2B557F0EF764,Conclusion.Kids of all age face the chance of being bullied in their education years. There will be a chance of a student being pulled regardless of the learning environment. At home away from others may seem like it will prevent bullying but it won't. Through social media kids can be targeted and parents may not always know that this is happening because kids won't know what to do ,3,2,69
2B557F0EF764,"Conclusion.In life we always struggle to learn new things about ourselves and broadenÂ who we are. Through challenges students face in school and the friends they make better help them understand who they are and develop their identities. Interactions in schools, different friend groups, and learning about the world in classes with others help students shape their identities. Students learn new perspectives from others and get to choose whether to agree or disagree but with online classes we don't have all these opportunities that help students develop their identities and broaden who they are.

2B7612A3D793,Conclusion.Sources from source 2: The Indefensible Electoral college: why even the best - laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumet. Reason 1Â  explains that many electors could ruin the president campaign and Reason 2 states many elector go for big states to cast in more votes other than small states. ,3,0,54
2B8374B25171,Conclusion.I get that they have to monitor the votes but arnt we already using electronic computers to vote... I think voting would go alot smoother if the votes went strait to the presidents through computers instead of having an elector who has a strong personal opinion against one political party who has a chance of twisting the votes around to strongly support the political party that he/she is opinionized towards. This why the Electoral Collage is dangerous. There have been cases of law breaking electors twisting the votes around. It is alot more safe to just let the citizens to just strait up vote. ,3,2,105

2C0023E82D72,"Conclusion.Classrooms are controlled settings where students are assigned specific tasks for a particular amount of time. Teachers and administrators also try to limit distractions for students by placing strict learning policies, such as, no phones during instruction. In my IB Business Management class, my teacher, Generic_Name, disgussed the advantages and the disadvantages of working from home. One major disadvantage of working from home was the increased level of distrations, which led to an ultimate decrease in productivity amongst workers. If adults are not able to implement online working from home efficiently and effectively, how can students? Students need the rigid structure that a classroom provides. The classroom setting helps aid in developing proper work ethics that students can use in their future careers. In sum, online school could lead to a decrease in student productivity rates, which further emphasizes why online education is not beneficial to students. ",3,2,148

2C1337136521,"Conclusion.In our society, technology is advancing significantly by the day. What was once a letter that took 10-day trip overseas to its appropriate destination is now just a simple text message that reaches a person within seconds. The automobile is an innovation that has also advanced dramatically, enough to the point where almost every person who can afford to have one does because of its necessity when transportation becomes a factor. The idea of a car becoming ""driverless"" is simply another boost in the technology available to cars today, as discussed in ""Driverless Cars are Coming."" ",4,2,98
2C1337136521,"Conclusion.For one, the necessity to have to buy or pay off a car would essentially cease to exist. If computer-operated vehicles were capable of driving in all areas, then what would the need for having your own car be? Even if the car wasn't ""fully automated"" and the driver would have to take over at some point, the less work you have to do, the more time you have to work on something else. The article addresses this topic ""Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays."" The biggest asset that the consumer gains from a driverless car is time, while still being transported in a safe and reliable vehicle.

2C2CF03355C9,Conclusion.When a college goes to accept a child they don't just look at grades. They look at what extra curricular activities they do. Community service shows the colleges that the kids will help out society if they want. This is also an EXTRA curricular activity so they weren't forced to do this. They did it because they wanted to and that is a great way to look at a student. The kids will also be more likely to be accepted by higher ranked college. ,3,2,85

2C8521890B5A,"Conclusion.But some people don't really know what they are voting for in election which is why the Electoral College is the way to go. Also people complained with the ""winners take all method"" some candidates don't go to certain states and only focus on the swing states. In the 2000 campaign seventeen out of fifty states didn't see the candidates. But the candidates didn't go to those states since they knew they had no chance of winning those states and they needed to focus on the swing states to make sure they win the election.

Now if the kid had a D average they should be taken off the team they are on so they can pull it up and not get low grades again.

2FC6AA5BBAE9,"Conclusion.However, parents would not have to worry about bringing their sick child to school, because school could bring itself to their sick child through a more flexible method of learning online.

And it's time for the President to see who or who he can't put his trust in. For example, A president has alot of things that we depend on him or her to do for our Country.

But I would go ahead and have them use their phones through out the day when they are not in classes. Like say it started snowing really bad at school that day and your coach tells you at school that there will be no practice after school. You could call or text your parent ahead of time during school that there is no practice. So it would be more efficient for you and your parent both. Your parent could go home earlier without having to wait for you after practice. I just think that it is important to have your phone at least when your not in class. ,3,0,124

30C6A72F5821,"Conclusion.The single best argument against the electoral collage is what might be what we (the american people) might call the disastor factor, We should consdier ourselves lucky that in the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a centry; the system can allow much worse. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy)

""Faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representives. Where state deleations vote on the president, and the senate would choose the vice-president. At the most basic level, he electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state.

Canidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winnning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 campain, seventeen sates didnt see the canidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a campain ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it... Originally the founding fathers estabished the electoral college in the Constitutuin as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress but i believe that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational!

312D8CFDF5DF,"Conclusion.The Electoral College is widely regarded as a anachronism, a non demorcratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overpowered by declaring the candidate who get the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are right in debatingthat the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When u vote you're not voting for the presidential u pick yor're actually voting for a slate of electoes. Both party each selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee but that trust is rarely betrayed however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Electoral college is good to stay.

318F40822873,"Conclusion.While in the classroom, it is difficult for teachers to go at a pace that isn't too slow or too fast for every single student since not every student learns at the same pace. I consider myself a relatively slow learner and writer. Therefore, there have been several instances where my teachers would be lecturing and giving notes, and I found myself missing key information because the teacher was not allowing time for us to write it down. However, unlike my other teachers, my history teacher will make us take notes at home. In this instance, taking notes and learning from home, helped me retain and learn the information better than if I were at school because I was not constantly stressing about the teacher switching the slides, and therefore, potentially missing key concepts. Giving students the opportunity to learn from home allows students to make sure they get all of the necessary information that they may need for later success on a test. It also gives students time to be able to make sure that they understand the information on the notes, rather than just typing or writing it down without understanding the meaning behind it. In addition, some of my teachers make assignments due at the end of class, despite some students, like myself, not being able to finish within the time constraint ",3,2,226
318F40822873,"Conclusion.I think that in a learning environment that should not be the case. Learning is not about being able to complete an assignment in an hour, but it is about being able to understand new information. ",6,0,37
318F40822873,"Conclusion.Furthermore, I constantly find myself being more focused doing my homework rather than trying to do my work in school because I am given an appropriate and quiet learning space that helps me concentrate on what I am doing. Allowing students to learn from the comfort of their home helps minimize the many potential distractions from other students and teachers that only cause problems with the student's concentration.

3214BA8B26E6,"Concluding Statement.Overall Mr. Senator, I believe that the Electoral College should not be used to determine who becomes the President of the United States instead they should use popular vote.

32E3A5BDD0B2,Conclusion.When i vote i like to know as soon as possible and i feel as if we had popular vote it would be faster to do. Opinoins may not be taken inconcideration but my opinion is strong that we should use popular vote i really feel like more people would come to vote if we used that. People may feel like the Electoarl College is too long of a process so they just say oh i dont have to go vote so im not going to. The Electoral College avoids elections but without them how would we know about our future president and how would we know whether or not the person would do a good job at running our country? ,3,1,122
33008B95DE9C,Conclusion.The president's have better chances of winning because they can have the most votes and wouldn't have to wait on the Electoral College. ,0,0,24
33008B95DE9C,"Conclusion.What's the whole point of voting then? People are out here voting for electors that they don't even know and most of the electors are people who not holding public office. In paragraph 13 it says, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" To me they are cheating people out of their votes, people vote for the one that they think could make a change not just voting just to be voting. ",3,0,102

They will know that what they are trying to set forward is good for some people and not just for them. Such as paragraph 12 says, ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" What would happen then? That's why you should just give it to the person with the most votes because they deserve it. ",3,1,83
33008B95DE9C,"Concluding Statement.I hope what I have really proved my argument that we should change the way a president is chosen so it can be fair to everyone. I think this will make the incoming president feel confident in himself to make this happen.

36403757FA10,Conclusion.Another reason electoral votes aren't right to me is because if a president wins the popular votes but not the electoral votes then it almost seems likes one of the types of votes is useful ,0,1,36
36403757FA10,Conclusion.It seems like this because then he/she may not win and become president even though they won the popular votes. The canidates shouldn't have to rely on 2 different types of votes because obviously one isn't fair. I feel that in a situation like this having popular votes is just a watse of time because it seems that the electoral votes are what matter the most. Not having an equal amount of electoral votes for each state really defeats the purpose. ,3,1,82
36403757FA10,Conclusion.The voting is done by the party's nominee that then elects a slate of electors to vote for the canidate but the problem is you can't always trust that they will actually vote for the canidate that they're supposed to be voting for. ,0,0,44

3A33CD269EA2,"Conclusion.The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electorals. When the electors have a meeting thats when they are able to for the President, Vice President that is running for office. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, majority of 270 electoral vote, is to elect the President. Each state is entitled allotment in its Congressional delegation which means one for each member in the House of Representives plus two for your Senators.

Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated three electors and are treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. Each candidate that is running in the election has their own group of electors, generally chosen by the candidate's political party. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The voters help choose their state's electorals when they voted for the President, when they vote for the candidate they are actually votin for the candidate's electors. Voters are more likely to pay attention to the efforts the candidate put to win the election like the campagin.

The Electoral College system has a method called ""winner- take-all that awards all the electors to the winning presidental candidate. After the presidental election the state governor will prepare a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" that which list all the of the candidates that ran for office, along with the names for their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winner of the presidental candidate of your state. The Certificate of Ascertainment is sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the offical records of presidential election.       Â Â Â        Â     ",3,1,278

3AD47B68A985,"Conclusion.In the Electoral College, ""voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"" (Bradford 10). These electors may not necessarily vote for what candidate voters want most as president, and could do what they might feel is the best decision; however, this is not always what the majority of voters want in a president and could end up with a poor president.

3C1F9041C565,Conclusion.Is it not time for a change in the Electoral College? ,5,0,12
3C1F9041C565,"Conclusion.First off, the Electoral College is a specified process. This process consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is manditory to elect the President. The way this works is every state has a certain number of electoral votes, mostly due to population. For example, a larger state with a large population will have more electoral votes than a smaller state. Also, each candidate running for president in your state has their own group of elector. These electors are chosen based opon the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. There is a presidential electon held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday of the month of November. When you vote, you are helping choose your state's electors. When you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candiate's elecotrs. After your presidential election, your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" showing all the candidates who ran for President in your state and with the names of their respective electors. This also shows which electors will be representing your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. ",3,1,207

3C5248E5C9F9,"Conclusion.Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy so that the popular vote for Kennedy wouldnt have acutally gone to Kennedy. Electors have often occasionally refused to vote for their partys canidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. I think that the electoral college is unfair to voters. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. They said the Electoral college is widely regarded as an anachornsim. Probably changing to election by popular vote it would be more fair to the people than the electoral college. The single best argument against the electoral college is what they might call the disaster factor. When you vote for a presidential candidate youre actually voting for a slate of electors. Thats why i think you should change to election by popular vote for the president. ",3,0,146
3C5CFABBA1F0,"Conclusion.Since the Electoral College was hundreds of years ago, it does not account for all of the new technologies that have been developed since then. ",0,2,26
3C5CFABBA1F0,"Conclusion.According to source 3, a supporter of the Electoral College, ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...."" This should not be the case when voting. Voters should research their choice as if the election relied completely on them. But instead, there is a system in place where somebody's vote can be rendered completely useless in not multiple ways! For example, if a state already has their majority of citizens voting for president A, if somebody votes for president B it will be as if they didn't vote at all! Even in a case where the state is completely 50:50 on who to give the electoral votes to, if the last person votes for president A, tipping the majority in his favor, according to source 2, ""... those electors could always defy the will of the people,"" and end up voting for President B. The Electoral College is an anti-thesis to democracy, because a citizen's vote can be rendered completely pointless at multiple points. ",3,2,185
3C5CFABBA1F0,"Conclusion.Both those who support the Electoral College system and those who oppose it agree that the Electoral College puts a much bigger focus on swing states and states with large populations, according to sources 2 and 3 ",0,0,38
3C5CFABBA1F0,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion, the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system as soon as possible. The Electoral College relies on archaic methods to make tallying votes simpler for the government, which results in problems. It's like the government is rounding the votes. The winner-takes-all method of the Electoral College can render a voter's vote completely useless, and it even allows representatives to vote for the presidential candidate that is against the voter's wills. Presidential candidates will not bother campaigning in states that are loyal to their adversary or are too small to be worth their time. While a single person's opinion might not seem important, or rounding votes seems ""easier,"" no corners should ever be cut when deciding who the leader of a nation with over 50 million citizens is, which is why the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system.

Also, talking to other classmates throughout your school may give you extra time to study with them or to finish a couple of assignments you were unsure about or needed help on. Communicating with cell phones will provide you extra time to do this by sending a text or giving them a quick call, after all lunch time and free periods don't last forever. This takes less time and gives you extra time for many other priorities you may have. ",3,2,113
3CA61DE9B5C6,"Conclusion.Also, students need a little free time during the school day. If time is given to them to have their cell phones out and to check what they need to, students may not be prompted to sneak a text in class. ",0,2,42
3CA61DE9B5C6,"Concluding Statement.All in all, changing the cell phone policy will benefit the school in various ways. There needs to be a sense of trust and knowing they have responsibility inside them first. Students aren't always going to do the right thing. However, giving them this time will allow them to escape and talk with friends that they may not see everyday.

Since 2009, the driverless cars have been able to navigate over half a million miles without a crash.

Along with the car's safety, it is also more efficient than a normal car.

The driverless car would use half the fuel of today's taxis and allow more flexibility than a bus, making them the ideal mode of transport.

Even though it is driverless, the car also requires human control.

The driverless car will be able to steer, break, and accelerate on its own, but it will alert the driver when the situation requires.

The human driver must take over in situations such as navigating construction zones or accidents.

Even though the car is not completely self-driving, it allows for the human driver to ultimately remain in control of the situation.

This is like bandwagoning for football teams. If they go to the national championship they will change to that team. This voting shopuld change to the peoples votes instead of this winner-take-all system. It is more fair and balanced.

Think of it this way in 2012 that more people voted for Mitt Romney but the electors didnt think so that is unfair. Right? The voting needs to be changed once and for all to a popular vote system instead of the Electoral College. This is the best way for the United States to deal with this madness.

42F0BEBB42B4,"Conclusion.If they choose to be in a club or any other school activity that requires them to do community service then they would have to or be kicked out of that club, if not then they should not have to. ",0,2,41
42F0BEBB42B4,Conclusion.The only reason that a student should have to do the community service when they are not in a club is if they got into some kind of trouble at school or during something related to school/on school grounds or if they accumulate so much detention that they don't make up another choice should be community service. ,0,2,58
42F0BEBB42B4,Conclusion.Another example is that if a student had accumulated over 24 hours of detention and it was close to the end of the school year or a dance/ field trip that they really wanted to go to was coming up they could just make it up with the amount of community service that you and other faculty members decide is fit for the circumstances. ,3,2,65
42F0BEBB42B4,Conclusion.My final example is that a student could have a friend that is having trouble with math and they want to help their friend they do community service and help their friend with whatever he or she would need help with or if they see a park that is full of litter they could help clean it up. Maybe doing that the student could get extra credit to help their grade if they need to push it up a little. ,3,2,81

",5,2,18
451D81265E8E,"Conclusion.According to source one, ""What Is The Electoral College?"", each political party has it's own set of electors that equal the amount of congressional delegates per state. Usually each state has a ""winner-take-all"" method, so the presidential candidate that gets majority in your state will get all of the electors that represent their party, not just most of them. This is beneficicial to the outcome of the election becuase it makes the ability for a candiate to get majority vote much simpler. There is less of a possibility of a tie, or an outcome where no candidate wins. Source 3, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing president"", states that ""even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state..."" , therefore allowing the candidate to secure all votes to their side, instead of having the votes divided on the line of majority rule, and causing rifts between Electoral College voters. 
",3,2,167
451D81265E8E,"Conclusion.In addition, the Electoral College fosters a more nationwide appeal for the candidate's campaign ",0,2,15
451D81265E8E,"Conclusion.Source 3 brings up the fact that no region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The ""winner-take-all"" system further benefits this, because in order to win, candidates have to focus their attention on states where their majority vote is insecure. They will not focus on regions where they have essentially secured the majority rule and therefore secured all the electoral votes. In popular vote, they would have to focus extensively on those regions, as the few that are not in the majority would need convincing. Source 3 goes into detail as to why a regionally picked candidate is not a proper show of the will of the people. It states that ""The residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised - to feel that thier votes do not count, that their new preident will have no regard for their interests..."", and so having a trans-regional appeal is essential to properly representing the will of United States citizens ",3,2,166

4933B56F9E7B,Concluding Statement.You should keep the electoral college vote the same without the popular vote because the winning candiate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. Aswell as the electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives majority of the votes cast. So I'm going to leave you with this. What will you choose? The popular vote of the electoral vote? It's up to you not. ,1,0,76

49586CD6A649,Conclusion.Nasa has went on three missions to Mars to take pictures. Each time they went there has been no trace of aliens. Also NASA upgraded their camaras each time they went to Mars. So the pictures were more clearer. ,3,0,40
49586CD6A649,Conclusion.This is because it was winter in Mars during the time NASA went. ,3,0,14

49EC678EC9BB,"Conclusion.The Electoral College has 538 electors, but to elect the President, 270 electoral votes are needed. One for each member in the House of Representives plus two for your Senators is what your state's entitled allotment of electors must equal and the number of members in its Congressional delegation. In the Constitution under the 23rd Amendment, D.C is given 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. ""State"" can also be used instead of using the District of Columbia. Each canidate running for President in each state has his or her own group of electors. The political party is who the electors are generally chosen by but they elect them by giving them different responsibilities. Every four years is when the presidential election is held. I believe that the senator should stick with The Electoral College to vote for the President of the U.S.

When the presidential election is all finished with, the governor prepares something called ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" which lists all of the canidates who ran for office in that particular state. ",3,1,182

''the founding fathers established it in the constitution'' that students over 18 can vote ",0,1,51
4A8FCC8C7D9B,Conclusion.The electoral college process consists many of the selection of the electors like meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president also counting of the electoral votes by congress. ,3,0,34

4ABA61F516D1,"Conclusion.That can't be right, yet it has happened plently of times before. It's even unfair to the people, who sometimes don't even get to see their electors. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, they don't focus of states they know they cannot win, aiming towards ""swing states."" In the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn't see their candidates at all, as well as 25 of the largest media markets who didn't get to see not one campaign ad.

4E83F1166BA9,"Conclusion.Admmitedely, the winner take all system is a fair way of deviding the votes. ",2,2,15
4E83F1166BA9,"Conclusion.In the first article ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, the author asserts, ""Most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all the electors to the winning presidential candidate."" If a presidential candidate spends alot of time, effort, and money in a campaign for a ""swing"" state; he should be awarded all the votes for winning that state. It is a high risk but high reward to spend all that time and money to only earn sixty percent of the votes. That is why a ""winner-take-all"" is crucial. To add on, the author of the first article mentions, ""Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are..."" This is saying that a candidate chooses his or her electors, and you vote for the electors to then choose the candidate you voted for ",3,2,174
4E83F1166BA9,"Conclusion.Additionally, Plumer explains, ""If you lived in texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry."" Why should kerry earn 34 electoral votes. He should earn the amount of voters in that state he persuaded to vote for him. He should not earn the electoral votes of all the people that did not think he was the best presidential candidate. Every vote should count, and that is why the electoral college should be eliminated. 
",3,2,89
4E83F1166BA9,Conclusion.A state with one representative should not have the equal amount of power as a state with 55. If popular vote is made the way of electing then the odds of a tie would be nearly impossible. ,0,2,38
4EB6E7B8DEC0,Conclusion.If there is no more Electoral college it would not be fair because we would not be able to vote for the president we desire. ,0,1,26

4F6084AE3A42,"Conclusion.The states that are larger such as Texas and california have a much larger population so the votes would be larger but the electoral college balances out and the smaller states such as new jersey and main have a small population so the votes wold be smaller. The larger states get more attention from the presidential candidates than the smaller states, so the electoral college balences it out.(sourse 3)

4FE5B872FE61,"Conclusion.To start, energy is being consumed in our world at a rapid rate, and much of it comes from sources that are nonrenewable once depleted like the oil used in many cars. Many have seen the solution to switch to alternative energy sources that ARE renewable; however, this does not actually address the bulk of the problem. ",3,0,58
4FE5B872FE61,"Conclusion.To demonstrate this, for power to reach a house from a faraway power plant, much more electricity is generated than needed as to make sure it can travel the long distance in cables without losing so much charge that the current becomes weak and useless, and a logical fix for such a problem would be to simply figure out a way to move the power source closer as to achieve higher efficencies. This same logic applies to cars in traffic, which use a lot of fuel to do essentially nothing. When I saw in the article ""Driveless Cars Are Coming"" that Google cofound Sergey Brin--who must be very intelligent as he IS the cofounder of Google, a very widely known and used company--said that these cars would use half the fuel of today's taxis AND offer far more flexibility than a bus, my only logical reaction was that this is a wonderful technology.

Even though a winner is often more clear, there is still a possibility of a tie between candidates. People who support the Electoral College also argue that its a good thing due to swing states having more attention payed to them and therefore being more careful in their decision. However, this reasoning is flawed in that it assumes that citizens of a state are more likely to inform theirselves thouroughly simply because their vote holds more value, in a sense. Also, candidates would no longer pay special attention to swing states if the electoral college weren't in place so the votes of these citizens wouldn't be held above the rest. Increased value of votes is not a good thing, which this argument also assume. It is the best decision to abolish the Electoral College.   ",1,2,158

522A99CEF90C,"Conclusion.To get into better universities, they will not accept grades that are not exceptional, let alone standard. I believe these students are trying to ""just get by"" in their class work, leading them to become irresponsible, lazy, and completely oblivious to the fact that the better jobs out there require more than a ""standard"" degree. Most school athletes believe that right out of high school, they will be drafted into a professional sports career, and for some, it is true. However, the statistics of ever making it into a professional league is slim, and for those who don't make it, and sadly don't care about their education, and end up getting a job that pays little to none and wishing that they did what they were supposed to do in school.

522A99CEF90C,"Concluding Statement.To make a long story short, why should students be able to do what they want, if they are not doing what they need to do.

525E2FD50DBF,"Conclusion.In article three where it says ""Everyone's President"" the author states that ""No region (South,Northeast, etc.) has enough electrol votes to elect a president."" This mean that most of the states in the south do not get the chance to vote for a presiden and this increases Romney chances of wining, and what if the candidate that wins with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president? The citizens of the United States will feel as if they aren't apart of this country, not giving the rights or freedom this country promised them. The citizens will feel like their votes do not count, when they have there opinion on something the new president will have no interest towards it, this means to us that he isn't really a president. In article last paragragh the author states ""people who think that a single vote may decide an elcetion.""In the past plenty of ties had happened before they handled this by the election would be thrown to the House of Representative.

527B7AAC2310,"Conclusion.studies show that five out of ten students are more distant just by taking classes from home. Being in a school can improve your communication skills that can be used in interviews, presentations, performances, or even if your just speaking to family or friends. It's one of the most important thing you'll need in life. Taking online classes at home is a totally different environment then being at school.

",4,2,72
52D49831B279,"Conclusion.If given the option to attend classes from home, more students would stay home and get the rest that they need in order to be healthy, because they would have an opportunity to stay on top of school, and not fall behind the rest of their class. ",0,2,48
52D49831B279,"Conclusion.Everyone has them, students and faculty alike. Some families live out of state or in other countries, causing students to be forced to miss weeks at a time. Throughout these weeks, the students would miss many lectures, assignments, tests, quizzes and important projects. Allowing those who are gone to stay on top by using a computer, would allow students to focus more on their family in a time of worry, instead of worrying how they are going to make up their test in their third period math class. The stress of having a family emergency on top of the already extremely stress inducing schoolwork, can become too much for many, leaving them exhausted and unable to catch up. The inability to catch up for some, can cause them to drop out of school all together, as the stress and pressure would build and build up. This can ruin students' futures and take a lot of opportunities out of their hands. ",3,2,161
52D49831B279,"Conclusion.Many students begin to stop caring when they fall behind, which leads them to stop showing up and stay home.

53B21C3A440F,"Conclusion.Moreover, classroom learning promotes comradery and friendships. Having friends in class makes learning more appealing and interesting. For example, debates and seminars develop critical thinking skills since other students can have a different, challenging perspective to share amongst each other about a topic; this causes them to respect each others opinions and promotes communication skills. ",3,2,56
53B21C3A440F,"Conclusion.Those types of classes allow students who need one or two more credits to graduate when they are supposed to rather than stay another year in school due to a few credits. For example, in IB schools, required classes, like a language class, may be taken online if the student's schedule does not allow them to fulfill that requirement since it is full. It is also possible for students to take online classes in the summer in order to make space on their schedule for next school year so that they can take classes that are intriguing to them. There are students who need to provide for their families at a young age but still want a high school diploma. Students who have jobs can take online classes with flexible times, so they can easily fit them into their daily life. ",3,2,142

You have small states like Alaska and Hawii who only have 3 or 4 electoral votes and other larger states like Texas and Florida who have 29 or 38 Electoral votes. The candidates running for president go to large states more so than small states, because they know that if they persuade the big states the will the election. ""The Electoral College may turn off potentail voters for a canidate who has no hope of carrying their state.""

In 2012 the people voted for obama it was 61.7 of the people who voted for the president and they compared it to rommey votes it was 51.3 that voted for him. its better to vote during the electoral college because the votes is mostly by gae 18 and above to vote. ,3,1,97

55D932D37D19,Conclusion.Consider that state legislatures are techanically responsible for picking electors and that those electors that were voted for couls always defy the will of the people. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. ,3,0,43
55D932D37D19,Conclusion.It does not make any sense to me how the president with the votes does not win the presidential election. The electoral college is unfair for all voters that vote. When you think of a vote and how it works you would think by the most one with the most votes wins cause that pretty much means that most of the people would rather have the most wins over the win that had less votes but more electoral votes. ,3,1,80
55D932D37D19,Conclusion.The only reason why people vote for the poplar vote because the if there is tie between the electoral vote it goes to the popularity vote. ,3,1,27
563F7AD6C619,"Conclusion.The Electoral college is all high and mighty and is a process that consists of the selection of the electors. During the meeting of the electors, they discuss the presidents and vice presidents that are trying out for there 'role' in society. They also align the counting of the electoral votes by the Congress men. If you did not know Senator the Electoral College or as we call it ""EC"" consists of 538 electors in the so called 'pole'.

563F7AD6C619,"Conclusion.""Winner Take All"" sound familiar to you. Maybe not but I am going to explain it anyway. The Winner Takes All System awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate. Except for the unlucky ones like Maine, and Nebraska they have something called the ""Proportional Representation"". All said and done the ""certificate of Ascertainment"" is introduced after the elction has partaken in. This lists all of the canidates who ran for President in your state choosen along with the names of there ""side kick"" the electors. This shows who will be in your country running for president and elector for the next 4 years until the next election. ",3,1,109

Working from home brings in a couple essential factors, that a lot of times are hard to find at schools which range from comfort, focus, and familiarity. One basic aspect that is often pointed to when talking about comfort at school versus comfort at home is the amount of noise pollution. While at school, you are often surrounded by twenty five to thirty other students who are all chatting and creating noise pollution in your work environment. However, while working at home, there is rarely any noise pollution because of the vastly lesser amount of people in your work environment.

I think that if everyone was to be able to individually vote for their president, there would be less chaos and arguements about the election and also the new president.Â But,Â it is possible that the winner of the electoral vote won't win the national popular vote. But, it is very rare. Some people don't bother voting because of the fact that their vote will have no effect.

5DD063D65899,"Conclusion.Source 1; What is the electoral collage?

The electoral collage is a process, not a place. The electoral collage process consists of the selection of the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president and the counting of the electoral of the electoral votes by congress. The electoral collage consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. The Congressional delegation one for each member in the house of representives plus two for senators. The 23rd Amendment of the constiton the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral collage. Each candiddate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party but state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are chosen by political party. The state law vary on how the electors are selected and their responsibilities. The presindential election are held every four years. After the president election the governor prepares a Certifiate of Ascertainment.

Source 2; The indefensible electoral college; why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong.

Under the electoral collage system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president. If you live in Texas and vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electores pledged to kerry would get 34 electoral votes. On the off-chance that those electora won the statewide election they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 votes. The single best argument against the electoral collage is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people are lucky that 2000 fiasco was the biggest eleection crsis in a century. Back in 1960 segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with the new electors who would oppose John F Kenney. He was a great learder.

Source 3; in dedense of the electoral college; five reasons the keep out despised method of choosing the president.

The number collage is widely regared as an anachronism a non- democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the electoral college method is not democrtic in a modern sense. When you vote for a president candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. There are five reasons for reatining the Elctoral college despite its lack of democratic pedigree all are practical reason not liberal or conservative reason. In 2012 election for example Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes. The electoral college requires a president candidate to have trans- regional appeal. The winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates as we saw in 2012 election to focus their campagign efforts on the toss up states. ",3,1,496

5E85F1FB4E22,"Conclusion.Driverless cars may be modern and use half of what todays taxis use . Yet they are not truly driverless, they still alert the driver to take over in certain conditions , for example pulling in and out of drive ways or driving through road work or accidents.

These smart road systems worked well but require massive upgrades to existiing roads , which is simply too expensive. So with out the smart roads a whole lot of sensors are needed on the car , one specific sensor is the special touch sensor which makes sure that the driver keeps their hands on the wheel at all times . Besides that there is also seats that viberate to alert the driver and flashing lights on the window shields , which would add on to the price of a car. Also stated in the passage that so far none of the cars are completely driverless. They can steer , accelerate and brake themselves but they still notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills . This means the human driver must be alert and ready to take over at all time. Which might not always happen , a driver may not always be attentive of the road ahead even with alerts included in the car. Which brings up the case of a drivers, passengers , and pedestrians saftey , and lawmakers know that saftey is best achieved with alert drivers , which is stated in the passage. Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Infering to why in most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars. Yet even if traffic laws change , new laws willl be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If an accident were to occur due to the technology failing , who is to blame the driver or the manufacturer. ",3,1,348

60C439A28A94,"Conclusion.For example, schools have their students build collaboration skills through group projects; online schooling or video conferencing does not provide this same benefit of collaboration. When a student is working from the comfort of their own home, they are not actively collaborating with other students; it is essential for students to have the ability to cooperate with other people in the real world. These group projects add the benefit of teaching students how to work with others in order to get certain tasks done, preparing them for when they have to inevitably work with other people they may not necessarily like. Online schooling is largely independent, and requires the student to rely on themselves and only themselves, while classroom settings teach both independence and dependence. Students must learn how to work with other people so that they can learn how to deal with individuals who are difficult to cooperate with, and so that they learn to rely on others when in need of assistance.

This can be frustrating for Democrats who live in Texas because they know that ",3,2,55
656C7C849144,"Conclusion.As stated before, the larger the population of a states, the more Electoral College votes that state gets. This leads to a small group of ""big states"" that have such a large amount of votes, they are the target for candidates to try to persuade to vote for them.

6578E97B8E0E,"Conclusion.After school activities help occupy students time which makes it less likely for them to get in trouble.

Another reason is that students might also drop out or move schools so they can continue playing sports.

659461FD20E3,"Conclusion.Many people are worried about this because the responablaite of chocing the president would be the house of represantives.

Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the eledtors where they vote between a President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The Electoral College has about 538 electors a majority of 270 are electoral votes is required to elect the President by which your state entitled allotment of electors equals the numer of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. The 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of the Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College.

67B143000AE2,"Conclusion.The first picture that was taken of the face on Mars was taken in 1976 and the quality back then was not as good as it is now. The picture that was taken in 2001 was a higher quality picture and scientists figured out that is was just a mesa and not a sign of any ancient civilization on Mars. For example the camera used in 1976, spanned 43 meters compared to the camera NASA used in 2001 spanned 1.56 meters. In the picture of 1976, the shadows that were present that day formed an illusion that made it seem like there was a face. In paragraph two of the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it says that, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.""

694238280A93,"Conclusion.I think the five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President was for its lack of democratic. The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. I disagree the advocates of this postition are correct in arguing that the Electoral college method is ot democratic in a modern sense. It is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When we vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors because we're not actually voting for the president, we're just voting for the slate of electors. Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. However it it entirely possibe that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections inn which no candidate receives a majority of the vote cast. I agree that they made the five reasons for retaining the Electoral College.

697647371E0B,Conclusion.Another reason why students should be allowed to use their cell phones during lunch and free times is because many are involved with some sort of after school activity. ,0,2,30
697647371E0B,"Conclusion.Students have so much homework to do when they come home from school, and sometimes it can become overwhelming. Students need to be able to spend time with friends after school and not be always thinking of all the work that needs to get done by the next day. Taking a short break is helpful and make them feel less stressed about their schoolwork. So, students should also be able to use their cell phones to call or text friends to schedule activities together. They can even study for an upcoming test or quiz together, so they can get a higher grade. ",3,2,103

Not only are we going too vote for him or her, were also going to tell our friends too vote for them also so the president can get the most likes and get elected. With the Electoral College, the votes have to go through a process and then the election goes from there. ",3,1,74
69ADC83F4BBE,"Conclusion.. People think that once a new president gets elected that, things around the world are going too change. Yet, when things dont change, they all say ""well, I only her/him for them because he/she looked as if he/she could change things."" Just because he/she LOOKS like they could change something, doesn't mean its going too happen. That's where the saying ""don't judge a book by its cover"" comes in. ",3,1,71
69ADC83F4BBE,"Conclusion.The president could be handsome or gorgeous and be the worst president in the United States and/or the president could be ugly and be the best president. In a president election, no one is going too care about the looks of the president. We're going too care about the person being voted for president, outlook on things as being the president.

According to Plumer, because many voters vote one party for president and another party for Congress, the House's selection will not entirely reflect the will of the people.

6C3E863C67FC,"Concluding Statement.All in all, the Electoral college has both its good things and their downfalls. As can be seen the bad out ways the good in this situation. A voters vote isn't necessarily direct because they aren't voting on a single representative, they are voting on a group of individuals in which they believe will vote for the candidate in which they choose. Also, being that the number of electors is based on a state's number of congressional represenatives it is an unequal and unfair number of electors per state. The electoral college can even cause an uproar if a tie ever falls in place because the ""tie breaker"" is left in the hands of the House of Representatives. Basically ""the electoral colleg is unfair, and irrational"" (paragraph 14) and it should be abolished because there is a great amount of mix ups and failures within the system itself.   ",1,2,150

The electoral college consists of 538 electors. each candidate running for president in the state has his or her own group of electors. the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their resonsibilities are. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress.

the electroal college is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed, however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national.

7263826C2217,"Conclusion.The majority does not follow the consitiution when voting for our new president, thus inducing an unfair campaine and an biased leader. The consitiution clearly states the Church and State are to be seperated, yet many Americans vote baised on the beliefs of their Church on matters of the State. The latest case of this happening was for the ban on gay marrige. Most voters voted in favor of the ban due a passage in the bible that stated that man shall not lay with another man as he lays with a woman, even though there is a homosexual couple in the bible, mathew/mathius something. The story aout a man named Dave and another named John, if i remember correctly, one of them said ""your love exceeds that of a woman"" or something close to that. There are a number of testiments that say not to judge others or to love everyone, but most focus on the one against those. Baising your vote on spiritual beliefs does not help anyone and is unfair towards those whos lifes you are negativly affecting. We should all think logically when voting for our leaders, and ask questions like 'who will this affect' 'how will this improve apon the lifes of my fellow Americans' 'will this improve our dilapitiating economy and crippling structe of the government' along with other questions that relate to how this canidate will improve apon the country as a whole.

74036EED2163,Conclusion.It can be argued that the electoralÂ  college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. Democrats in texas for example or republicans in california knowing their vote will have no effect they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign that they would have if the president were picked by popular but of course no voters vote swings a national election and in spite of that about one half the elgible american population did vote in 2012 election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election ,3,1,120
74036EED2163,"Conclusion.A dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible it happened in 2000 but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote the reason is that the winning candidates share of the electoral college invairably exceeds his share of the popular vote in 2012's election for example Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney .Â  . . . because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner take all basis even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that state A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes 538 is an even number but it is higly unlikely .....

Citizens for popular vote do believe it is unfair to the voters having a board of senators making the big vote/impact on the president, but those senators are highly trusted people who know what they're doing.

74CA2200A7FB,"Conclusion.Controversial. This is the word that can describe the Electoral College in recent elections. The Electoral College is composed of 538 votes, a presidential candidate must acquire 270 to win the election. States with large populations get more electoral votes so say, Rhode Island. California gets 55 votes while the puny Rhode Island gets a whopping 3 votes.

754CED955EFD,"Conclusion.source 1: what is the electoral collage?

by the office of the federal register

The electoral college is a proccess,not a place. The founding established it in the U.S. constitution as a compromise between election of the president and the congress and the election of the president by a polpular vote of qualified citizens.(

paragraph, 1 sentance, 1).

The electoral college consists of 538 electors a majority of 270 electors votes are required and is reqiured to elect the president(paragraph 3 sentance 1) ",4,1,87
754CED955EFD,"Conclusion.Richard A. Posner reason 1:

Certainty OfÂ  Outcome

Dispute overÂ  the out come is possible-it happend in 2000- but its less likely than a dispute between popular vote. the reson is that winnning candidate's share of electoral collage invariably exeeds his share of the popular vote.

reason 2

:

Everyone's President

The electoral collegeÂ  requirs canadates to have trans-regional appeal. no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional such as Mitt Romneywas in the south,has so innocently favored for he gain electoral vote by increasing his plurality in those states and if done he know he'll win.

reason 3

:

Swing States

The winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes inducesÂ  the canidates-as we saw in [2012's] election- to focus their campaign efforts on the toss up states. Voters in toss up states are more likeley to pay close attention to the campeign to really listen to the competeing canidates knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likeley to be on the most thoughtful votes, on average(and futher reason they will have recived the most information and attention from the canidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the one to decide the election.

reason 4

:

Big States

The electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states have (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionmentof the senate decreed in the constitution. The popular vote was very close in Florida [2012] never the less obama, who won that vote got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in woyming would net the winner got 3 electoral votes.

reason 5

:

Avoid Run-Off Elections

The electoral college avoids run-off elections wich no canindate recives a majority of the votes cast. For example , Nixion in 1968 and Clinton both had only 43% plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral college. There is pressure for run-off elections when no canidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure,wichwould greatly complicate the presidential election processes.

754CED955EFD,Concluding Statement.So you see that is is easier and less complex to do an electoral vote instead of a popular vote. Thats why i think it is manditory that we keep the electoral collage because it is a more orginized system that prevents some of the problems we see today.

The electoral college consists of 538 electors and the majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. The amount of members in its congressional delegation, ""one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two of your Senators"".

76D946F75D6A,Conclusion.I don't have a cell phone because there is no room on the plan for me right now because I have five sisters and four brothers. In my school you are aloud to bring your cell phones but you can't use it at all in school. ,3,1,47

771C8CAD2E80,"Conclusion.Therefore, I'm sure these students don't have the time after school to do community service. If those kids had to do community service, it would most likely add stress to their lives and give them less time to do homework, so their grades could begin to slip. On the weekends is when kids relax and have fun with their friends and family, so it wouldn't be a good idea to make community service time on the weekend.

780B302C5523,"Conclusion.if you are in a constrution zone or near an accident the car has you take over. The car isn't full capable of handling driving in a situation like that. The car lets the driver know when they should take over. So the question is "" If the car is driverless how come you have to take over in certain situations""? Why can't the car handle it all on its own since the car is smart? For the driverless cars to be very smart they need a bunch of sensors.

My postion on driverless cars is I think they are a bad idea. They can't fully handle all situations. Also if the person behind the wheel is drunk or worse and they come upon a bad accident "" What will they do""? "" How will they act""? Since the car can't handle itself and the driver is incoherent I dont think the ending result will be very good at all. ",3,0,161

Each state's number of representatives is determined acoording to polpulation with California having the most electorial votes at 55.

This makes a student stress a lot thats why working at home you wouldÂ not be worried about who would be taking to and back from school. It also makes the student more productive because they would not have to find a ride all the time they could study and get their work done faster than other people. Also coming to school late makes it very hard to understand what was taught in the classroom making a student very stressed over it because a student grade might go down because he or she failed the test cause they came late to school so that student might not have understood what was taught. ,3,2,185

When we are so privileged to have a nice home, clean water, and a meal on the table every night we should at least be able to go out for an our or two and help someone else who isn't as privileged. Its hardly a great burden to get up from the computer or desk you are at, put on a pair of old jeans and a t-shirt, and go out and help.

Distance learning in theory is a great idea because of how convenient it is, but the main reason why distance learning would not benefit students is because of how convenient it is.

8F6F0CD4986A,"Conclusion.. If a regular car gets into an accident, we have laws that say who should be at fault. Also, it can already be complicated to figure out who should take the blame today with regular cars. If we all drove driverles cars, a new stack of laws would have to be made to support them. Getting used to those laws would be hard because we have never lived in the world of driverless cars. In the article it says, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" This is a good point. If there is an accident where someone gets injured, not everyone will agree who should take the fall for it. There will be riots and fighting between manufacturers and individuals, and overall, it is not worth it. We should not destroy what we already have for something this risky. ",3,2,152

90981BB41313,"Conclusion.In most presidential elections the presidents are elected by the percentage of popular votes wich I dont think is right. For example as stated in source 3 # 1, Obama recived 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney...Because almost all states award electoral voted on a winne takes all basis, even a very slight plurality in aÂ  stste creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is an even number, but its highly unlikley. Most times the 2 candidates running for president try to persuade the people and some people are fooled by ones promises and when that candidate gets electedÂ  the people do not like the outcome wich messes up alot. The people should go by the important things that the cadidate say they try to fix, not by the promises that they are making to get it done for sure. Stated in Source 3, It can be argued that the electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate whp has no hope of carrying their state democrats in texas, for example, or republicans in california. Knowing thier vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay atteneion to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular voters vote swings a national election, and in spite ofÂ  that, about one half the eligible American population didÂ  vate in 2012's election.

916117BFE2A1,"Conclusion.When the elector votes for their prefered president, all the votes used on that elector counts for the president. Instead of going through this whole process, would'nt it be less of a struggle to just have citizens vote for the president of their choice and win by popular votes? Also stated in source 2 ""Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" This shows how the Electoral College is difficult to understand for some people. The Unites States consists of many people who come from other counrties and speak other languages. This makes it even more complicated for some to understand even if the process is translated, and just by eliminating this process, it could make Presidential elections less complicated. ",3,2,129
916117BFE2A1,"Concluding Statement.Electing a president is very important to the country. Electing the president that people think could help support the U.S is also very important but very difficult as well. People should be able to easily vote for their prefered president with no difficulty, which happens to be caused by the Electoral College. By aborting this process, voters could control who they vote for and have a say in their country by voting for their prefered president. Having citizens tricked into voting for an elector is not the way to elect a president. Should'nt people in the Unites States have a say in who their president should be without being tricked?

That being said the only way for students to feel that way is by sending them to school.

Not being punctual can not only hurt people in their professional lives, but also in their personal lives.

Students who are schooled online may not know what type of relationship or the nature of interactions they should have with future employers or coworkers because that is something that puclic school students practice every day without thought, therefore it is not in the curriculum for the online students to learn ",3,2,102
91B1F82B2CF1,"Conclusion.Public school students encounter people of many different races, religions, sexualities, ableness, and neuro activity. Because of this, these students have no problem facing the real world with all the people who are nothing like them. Online students may experience a type of culture shock when they go to college or enter the workforce and meet a person who is a different race than them, someone with a disibility, a person on the autism spectrum, or even a person who practices a different religion than they do. This is a sensation unknown to most public school students because of how they are exposed to many different and diverse groups of people at a young age. This type of culture shock could cause problems for these online students in our increasingly open-minded and progressive world. ",3,2,135

945820293694,Conclusion.This development is crazy because it will change many things. We should keep cars the way they are instead of changing them to something different that not everyone would like. ,3,0,31
945820293694,Conclusion.You should be able to control the car whenever you want . Imagine if you come to a stop sign and the car doesn't stop? that could seriously cause a problem. Somebody could get hit and that will not turn out good. ,3,0,42
945820293694,"Conclusion.Other cars like BMW's and Gm have developed mny different things for cars. In the article for example says a BMW has a ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" whitch means the car can handle driving funtions at speeds up to 25 mph. What if the car was to stop working and keep going and not being able to stop? what would happen ? Nothing good would. GM has developed driver's seats to vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. What if you trust this vibrator and you wait till it vibrates to stop backing up and the vibrator fails and you hit something? that could be dangerous. You could back into a kid or person and run them over. You could also hit an object and damage your car. ",3,0,132

945CCBB52DED,"Conclusion.According to Source 3, in the 2000 election, Al Gore had a majority of popular votes, but less electorial votes, so he lost to Bush. This isn't even the first time it has happened, it has happened previous times throughout U.S. history. This is a clear example of how flawwed the Electorial College system. Between the possibility of the people's votes not counting for anything, and that they don't even actually vote for their preffered canidate, this system needs to be replaced ",3,0,84

94B72A7C1E6B,"Conclusion.To start off, Electoral College should continue to determine the president and vice president voting rather than popular votes because electoral college avoids run-off elections. ",0,0,26
94B72A7C1E6B,"Conclusion.If somebody was running for either president or vice president and they recieved thirty percent in popular votes, nobody would know if the person with thirty percent popular vote would win the election. Electoral College prevents confusion by producing a clear winner. For example, in source 3, the text reads ""Richard Nixon in 1968 and Bill Clinton in 1992 had only forty-three percent of popular votes but both had three-hundred and plus electoral votes which made them win the election"". The president and vice president make sure our country is running well and that we as a country have no problems. If we were to determine our president and vice president by a popular vote, whoever could kiss up more to the voters would win the election even if the person running doesn't meet up to the qualifacations of the person they are running against. Avoiding a run-off election is very important because no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. ",3,0,163

96BF2953ED8F,"Conclusion.In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradfor Plumer, Plumer explains that one of the best arguments against the Electoral College is that the rate of disaster is so high. In 2000, there was a elctoral crisis based upoun the Electoral College, because Al Gore recieved more individual votes, but George W. Bush still won the election. ",3,2,67
96BF2953ED8F,Conclusion.Some argue that a few votes can not do a lot and that the Electoral College is a far more organized way to conduct the voting. ,2,0,27
96BF2953ED8F,"Conclusion.Bradford Plummer believes that one of the most worrying thoughts is that there will be a tie with the electors. If that were to occur the elction would fall into the hands of the House of Representitives, resulting in all the states, no matter what their population is, having the same amount of votes, casuing a president that may be very far away than what the majority of the United States actually wants. This may seem unlikely but in fact there have already been many close calls. In 1968, only 41,971 votes would have deadlockes the election. In 1976 a tie would have happened if 5,559 voters in Hawaii, and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way (The Indefensibel Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, by Bradofrd Plummer.) A tie may occur and if it does, A lot of citizens would be very upset that the president did not win by popularity, but by the Electoral College. ",3,2,170

98A2AD61198B,"Conclusion.This free time is also beneficial to students as it is an opportunity for them to explore career choices and other things that interest them. Free time gives these students a chance to be involved in the community more through different things such as volunteering, having a job, working for an internship, and so much more. For example, one online student I know likes to volunteer at the animal shelter when she can because she wants to become a veterinarian. Her free time allows for her to learn more information and develop the skills for what she wants in the future. It sets kids up for success rather than failure by allowing them to find interests in high schoolÂ rather than switching subjects every year in college. This free time lets them create a more lasting impact on their community while also finding out more about the real world and what it hold for students when they graduate. ",3,2,159

99FD4F79B07D,Conclusion.Also if we don't pay attention to the teacher we wont be able to understand the work or the homework she gives us and we wont do it because we don't understand it. If we don't do our work or our homework we are going to get bad grades and our grades are going to go down. That's my other reason why i think we should be able to bring cell phones instead of bringing them when we cant and be using them in school.

Online learning can help a student break out of their shell and talk to their teacher more about their questions and get a more in depth experience in an online classroom.

Even with this prestegous process sometimes there are instenses were the ""underdog"" wins the electoral votes and

the popular votes. Although these instenses are little to non-exsitent.

""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that is rarely betrayed)... [;however,] it is entirely possible that the winer of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that as happened very rarley. It happened in2000, when Gore had more popukar votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.""

Students who have to travel often due to highly competitive sports do not have time to work on assignments while at tournaments, games, and competitions, but coaches for clubs and travel programs have rules about the grades their athletes have to keep to be able to play and travel; this will keep athletes from getting far behind and from being unprepared on graded assignments on new subjects.

A61D07193089,Concluding Statement.All I'm saying is that it wouldn't be fair to the students if you were to follow through with this policy. Too many kids love sports and have a c average.      ,1,0,33

Here are my three examples that prove that its just a mesa ",5,0,22
A6504C463F7E,Concluding Statement.To conclude these are the reasons why its not aliens. NASA would get more funding if they said it was aliens. They took a clearer picture of it in 2001 and it proved it wasnt a face. Lastly we have lots of mesas on Earth and someone siad theyd seen one like The Face on Mars by a river in Idaho ,1,0,63

A67D3F549FAD,"Conclusion.Imagine you are attending classes at home you wouldn' t take it seriously as you do at school. Kids who are home schooledÂ don't usually focus as much as they would at school. Some kids parents or tutor would give them more advantages that aren't given at school. Such as more breaks, better food options for lunch,linear schedule, and starting and ending time being optional. If students are learning a specific lesson by a video conference they wouldnt benefit the lesson as well as being offline. ",4,0,88
A67D3F549FAD,"Conclusion.Although,some may believe schools should offer distance learning as an option for students because they need a numerous amount of breaks, they should be able to work on their own time, and it's the same as an online class. ",2,0,41

A723DDC8ABF0,"Conclusion.Community Service is basically helping others in a way where you accept nothing in return. Some activities that are community service include picking litter up around your neighborhood, visiting the elderly, helping a teacher, etc. It's the little things we can do. ",3,0,43
A723DDC8ABF0,Conclusion.Community service will be beneficial to our school because it will help the students learn self value. ,0,0,18
A723DDC8ABF0,Conclusion.The reason for this is because the student may learn that just by helping someone that it can mean a whole lot to that one person; which may or may not lead them to realising the important things in life and the things they value. ,3,0,46
A723DDC8ABF0,Conclusion.Then there is the issue of students believing that community service takes too much of their free time. ,2,0,19

Just imagine what would happen if a car pulled out in front of you, sure these machines will probably have a pretty good reaction time.

A7EA8CF2F203,"Conclusion.(said in paragraph 19 line 2 paragraph 4) Take obama for an example, he was the first black presidental canidate and most of the darker skined group of people got excited because for the first time in history a black man could be president,many blacks thought that voting for the black president would mean that they would better respersatition in office,so many blacks and some whites voted for obama to win. Not really paying much attention to what or who they were voting for. Which you could probably figure out that obama won they had the bigger vote. If we are able to keep the electoal college it would mean that wouldnt happen agian because it could go through the electorals they would choose who is best. Dont get me wrong people actually voted for obama anyways ,because of what heÂ  stood for but most didn't. ",3,1,149
A7EA8CF2F203,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion,I beleive that we shoudl keep the electoral college becaue he keeps the people for choosing a president direlcetly.

A7EC6F462F8B,"Conclusion.but a better way to observe the idea of a driverless car is to think of it as a car, just like any other, with a few extra features; and one of those features happens to be that the car is capable of driving itself. ",6,2,46
A803835B8164,Conclusion.It is not fair that the general population does not get an independent vote. ,0,0,15
A803835B8164,"Conclusion.it is dependent upon which party the elector chooses. Voters don't have control over who their electors vote for. As said in the second article, Al Gore won the popular vote in 2000 against Bush however, Gore lost the electoral vote resulting in the loss of the presidential election. In the past, there have been voters who refused to vote for their party's candidate and voted for whomever. There is also the concern of a tie in the electoral vote.

If that were to happen then there would certainly be no chance that the popular vote would have an impact on the selection of the president because it would now be in the hands of the House of Representatives. ",3,0,120

A817C51F0787,Conclusion.How they create it as a form of a face. It's not like aliens just have tools laying around and they sculpt when they are bored. It started to form over the years. The way it was forming and the shadows around it just made it look more of a face. ,3,0,52
A817C51F0787,"Conclusion.That would have been big proof that aliens do exist. After all scientists have been trying to look for any other life on other planets for over the years. So that just says NASA also sees it as just a natrual landform.

A850DCCFB6DE,"Conclusion.Chossing your president is something very important and we need a way , a method to help us pick the right one. The Electoral College is the best way of picking the right president and doing it right. If you pick your president by a popular vote it would only lead to a disaster. In our world we need a method like this one that will guide us to make the right desion and something as imporatant as our President, well we can just pick out of anything we have to do itÂ  wise and neat so the right choice is picked ",4,2,102
A850DCCFB6DE,"Conclusion.The second source that I used in researching this topic is called "" In the defense of the electoral college."" This article they give you five reasons to keep our method of choosing the president. That one that was best for me was that "" Everyones's president"" just beacuseÂ  at the end of the day what's important is choosing the right president for the job that the reason this method was created. I read the part where it say even if we do let the people vote , some people will end up feeling like their votes don't count simply cause they live in a small town with a very low population.

A9105216AAA3,Conclusion.I believe that driverless cars should be developed ,5,0,9
A9105216AAA3,Conclusion.One major consideration for the development of the driverless car is the environmental benefits ,0,2,15
A9105216AAA3,"Conclusion.The reliance of a driver within the driverless car finalizes the development of the driverless car. If the car encounters a foreign situation, the driver will just be notified and will take over from there. This concept of passing over the responsibility of driving makes the driverless car very safe. As long as there is an alert driver within the car, the car is almost certainly not going to make any accidents. Car developers designed the driverless car to ""steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" Thus, the car will do most of the driving and when there is a difficult situation, the human driver will take over. This ensure the utmost safety of the driver and the passengers as there is an extremely low risk of an accident occuring. There are ""driver's seats that vibrate"" and the Google car even ""announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."" This increases the safety of the driverless car as the driver will be notified when to take over. Therefore, the driver will also know the situation and will be ready to handle any troubles the driverless car couldn't handle. The safety features positively affect the development of the driverless car. ",3,2,215
A93FA7E8FB81,Conclusion.I think that the electoral college is a certain way of cheating in a presidency that you dont want to win. When people in the states vote for a new president they're giving all of they're votes to the electors ,3,1,41
A93FA7E8FB81,Conclusion.This is one of the biggest reasons I think its not fair. ,0,0,13
A93FA7E8FB81,"Conclusion.Why should everyone be putting they're trust with votes into people they dont know? Even when I read the passage I saw that the electors could possibly get confused and vote the wrong way and if many of them end up doing that you can ultimately end up with the wrong president. 
",3,0,53
A93FA7E8FB81,Conclusion.Another big flaw that the electoral college consists of is what if it does end up getting a tie ,0,0,20
A93FA7E8FB81,"Concluding Statement.If it wasn't for our electoral college, we would've never had George W. Bush as are president. He didn't even get the most votes! but since our electoral college can vote for whoever he ended up winning anyways. I think this topic is obviously a one sided question cause there's obviously a right answer here. Abolish the electoral college! ",1,0,61

A95B8B50E0C1,Conclusion.there are plenty of reasons why kids should be able to use cell phones in school. ,0,1,17
A95B8B50E0C1,"Conclusion.One big reason we should have cell phones in school is they could be used for all kinds of things like say i am in social studies class and the teacher asks a question and nobody knows the answer then kids could get on there phones and look up the answer. Another reason would be that students rarely study, much less every night but, if they are allowed to use there cell phones then that makes studying easier and more fun. ",3,0,82

AA0FF7AA95C3,"Conclusion.I have a very strongly worded, persuavive letter written for you today of why our united nation, must abolish the electoral college. I am aware that the electoral college is one of the main ways president's become elected, but it's serving an unjustice to our nations people. You must do something of the crisis that our country is facing with the Electoral College. ",4,2,64
AA0FF7AA95C3,"Conclusion.The candidates running for the presidency only visit the largly populated states in order to get their electoral points, for instance, most candidates go to Californa or Texas becuase those are the states that have for electoral points. But, by doing this all the smaller states that have less electoral points are never visited by the candidates, the voters then may have never seen an ad or campiagn for a certain candidates . According to Source 2: ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"", by Bradford Plummer, it states, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and votes in 25 of the media markets didn't get to see a single campiagn ad"". On the contrary, it is stated by Source 3: In defense of the Electoral College, it states,"" No reigon has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" This is true, but candiadtes focus on larger states that will supply them with more electoral votes, and don't even visit or pay any attention the smaller states. I strongly negate the Electoral College. ",3,2,194
AA3205AA362D,"Conclusion.Really, is that why people vote? So you are saying that people vote just because they prefer, or like, the person other another candidate. So going back to my earlier point, people are just so amazed at their ""something"", that they just decide to take the effort to vote for them. No, people, that's not why, it's because they think they can make a change in the everyday world. ",6,0,70
AA3F8EC40764,"Conclusion.The idea of the self driving car is courageous, but it will not work for our society. ",5,2,18
AA3F8EC40764,"Conclusion.First, driverless cars can drive at ease when other driverless cars are in uniform with the other cars, but when one car has someone drivng the car then the driverless cars aren't able to predict the outcome the real driver will make. ",0,2,43
AA3F8EC40764,"Concluding Statement.the idea of driverless cars cannot be comepletely viable for safety of passengers and safety of citizens on the side of the street. There is no way driverless cars could be able to completely predict a real drivers movements. The cars could be hard for everyone to buy and adapt to. Last, you cannot find true blame for a driverless cars action when there is not anyone to blame. The driverless cars will not work in a society that is not ready for it. ",1,2,86

I know it has 538 electors and 270 of the electoral votes are needed to elect president.

But i do not know why so much people bash The Electoral College when its a good thing. ",4,0,78
AAA72CBAC7F8,"Conclusion.Based on my research, The Electoral College should stay and should be used everytime in an election for President. ",5,0,20
AAA72CBAC7F8,"Conclusion.Based on Richard however, ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed"". Its possible to win the electoral vote but not the national popular vote. It happened in 2000, with Gore when he was running. ",3,0,48
AAA72CBAC7F8,"Conclusion.No one really knows the elctors and they cant be seen holding public office. It depends on the state to pick the electors and voters cannot always control whom their electors vote for.

AAFC3D84F9A1,"Conclusion.Electoral College? Are you serious? Why is the election set up like this? I though it was a free country. But no. You guys practically vote on your own. You just make it look like you guys care, taking advice from the people in the states, but it's really just your decision. I want to choose freely, not think I am choosing freely. The President is a person who takes action in the country and we the people, want to choose the right one. You guys even show it sometimes.

AB3622039528,Conclusion.The main reason i think we should not keep the Electoral Collage is because its unfair. ,0,0,17
AB3622039528,Conclusion.When the winner take all method happens voters in toss up states are more likely to pay attention to the campaign. They receive the most information and attention from the candidates. Even if they go all out when its time to start voting that doesnt mean that they should be able to decide the election. Everyone elses vote matters too. ,3,0,61

ABC648A86887,"Conclusion.Under the electoral college, voters vote not for the president, but for a state for electors, who in turn elect the president. The main problem with this is that most of the time voters are oblivious to who their electors vote for. In some cases, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party candidate and cast a deciding vote for whome ever they please... The states pick the electors that vote for us citizens.

Sometimes the president doesn't even get the most popular vote, but they recieve enough electoral college votes, is this system a scam? ",3,0,99

ABC9EBAB6670,"Conclusion.It is a group of highly educated people that come together every year during the presidental election and choose wisely who the want to become president and vice president. Once everyone is complete choosing who they select, they add them up and seperate them by each state. Keep in mind, each state only gets a certain number of electors, depending on how big the state is. For example, Florida, the state that I live in, gets 29 electoral votes, as to Hawii, which only gets four votes. ",3,0,88

Others may have to watch their younger siblings at home because their parents come home late at night and are unable to care for the little children.

All over, there are people who vary in opinions, beliefs and lifestyle which can cause the Election of the president to become an important subject matter.

AD1914496798,"Conclusion.In an election their really is a process of voting and voting again. Instead of couting the number of people who want a certain president and so on. We are viewed as a state and some states having more say than other even if the votes are in the same margin. This is the reason why some states are focused on more by the candidates and are heavily educated on the topic and given more attention than smaller states whose votes wont change much. an even bigger problem is te fact that most states operate on a winner-take-all basis so even a slight majority vote one way will give that person all of the votes. A very worrying prospect as expressed in source two is the possibility of a tie. in which the election would be given to the house of representatives. Each state only gets on vote so a representative representing 500,000 people would have as much say as representatives representing 35 million people. ",3,2,167
AD1914496798,Concluding Statement.With all of the reasons to go against this process I think it is necessary to change the election to popular vote for the president.

B237EA09433F,"Conclusion.The Declaration of Independence granted us the right to control our government. Thomas Jefferson once stated, ""When a nations government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of its people to abolish it and establish a new government."" After viewing the articles Source 1:""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal register, Source 2: ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, andÂ  Source 3:""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner it seems clear that the Electoral Colleges have lessened the power of the people in our nation. With the Electoral College method of selecting our nations new president the people of our nation become less empowered, they may cast their vote but the choice of president is never truly theirs. The Electoral Colleges drive people away from voting because they see the election as if their vote will not matter. ",4,2,172
B237EA09433F,"Conclusion.In Source 2 Plumer declares, ""faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate"". With this method of selection for our country's president, the vote is never certain. The slate of electors that the people essentially vote for may or may not stick to the original plan. This ties back into people losing hope that their vote will not matter because they trust the electors to vote their canidate into office, when the electors could go either way. Another key point is, the canidates may not campaign in states that have a lower number of electoral votes. In Source 1 the Office of the Federal Register also asserted, ""Most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate"". Due to the Electoral College system being based off population some states have more of a say than others. Whenever a state decides their votes for Electoral Colleges the state typically contributes every vote it has to one canidate. When this occurs the state's people may be misrepresented. ",3,2,174
B237EA09433F,"Concluding Statement.Although the Electoral College has a few appealing qualities, it is mostly an unfair system for the United States. The colleges should not have the power to decide the president, that should be the people that reside in the country's choice. Thomas Jefferson spoke of the people taking control of their country's government and the citizens of America should do just that if they are ever to escape the grasp of the Electoral Colleges ",1,2,76

B27585EF3751,"Conclusion.lets say Florida has twenty because of its size, and California has fifty. if both states want to vote for someone different, then California is going to win only because of the size and population difference.

We need to ask ourselves what the best thing is for our country... letting everybody be dissapointed in who was voted for, or seeing that they got what they spent time on going and voting on. This isn't just a captain for a football team, or a manager at work. This is the president of the United States, and he or she will be running our country for 4 years or even longer, so we need to question this method of voting. We are a unified country, and our unity shows what we want as a country..we shouldn't have one thing chosen and get something completely different in return.

B28B37BFCC03,"Concluding Statement.The reason people should have to perform community service are listed above. And also, this could lead to a terrible community in the future.

B29198FD0748,"Conclusion.What i mean is ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Americans have always wanted to be in power and have a say in what we do but in the case of voting we do not. By doing this we are allowing the government to make all of the decisions for us, as if we were children. When you turn to the legal age for vothing your vote should count. With this majority does not rule, for instance say our votes of 46 percent and 54 percent were to come in. The man of the 46 percent still has a chance of winning when the people had already voted. The problem with that is at that point the peoples word goes out the window, and the government once again jumps in demanding that they choose. ",3,2,152

B2C131C2B3AB,"Conclusion.when you are voting for the cadidate you are voting for a slate of electors that were choosen by the congress, and the people will decide who they wanted to be their president and this is all about the people, and their opinion because they are the ones who vote for the candidate and they want him or her to be the president.

B2C131C2B3AB,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion, many people today prefer and thank to the founding fathers of creating the electoral congress becuase is way more better. every one who is part of the united states can vote for the candidate that they want. the electoral congress was a great idea and everyone enjoys it becuase they are the ones who give their opinion to the congress and choose the candidate that they want to have for four years, giving benefits to the united states and there is a perfect example of our current precident who is doing a great job taking care of the united states.

It was made as a compromise between the election of a president through a vote from Congress and election through popular vote. The downside to this way of election is that the voters are not voting for one of the candidates but for their state electors, who then vote for the president. The votes from each of the states electors then count as votes for the candidate ",4,2,79

You may say that the landform is created by aliens and we're just hiding it from you, but you're sorely mistaken because this discovery would help NASA as a whole if we did reveal it.

They're scared to talk around others, so they prefer working by themselves. In school, sometimes you're forced to work in groups or participate in a discussion which will frustrate that student and they won't be able to do it. Consequently, it will effect their grade. This proves my claim by saying that students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they won't have to worry about working with others or talk except for the teacher if it's online conferencing.

It can be dangerous because they can track where that person is at alll times. They could tell if they're home or not and the owner can possibly end being robbed. Another way it would be dangerous is that the person that had hacked the car could control the car and may end up hurting the driver or people around the car. ,3,1,83

If the driver was to ignpre that notification it cause an accident and many people may be injured.

The electoral college is the right to selecting/voting for president and vice president and people like that. Now to began on with the reasons i think it is important is that's a sign of are freedom to me that gives us a right to vote for who we want running this economy. Not being able to vote for this kind of thing could be bad because when we vote for the people we want running this economy we are choosing wisely because we don't want this town or anything to come crashing to the ground because of some man or woman who really doesn't care about the people they just want their name to be heard. ,3,0,147

Studies show that when a student is in a happier or more welcoming environment tend to do better on tests, quizzes, and homework than children who are in an unhappy environment studying. If we take the student who is good at their sport and make them quit the team just because they have a bad grade, then we would be making a bad environment for the people who want the team to win and succeed, and that would affect how they learned and studied. This would not be good for the schools' public image because every school wants to look good. If we start to make our school look very bad just because a sports team lost which they thought would win but didn't, that might make many of our students feel bad and a bit disappointed.

The easiest way to make friends as a kid is going to a public school. Not only does school help kids get friends, but it also teaches them how to interact with people in the real world. When a student is put through an online course at home, the easiness to make friends and interact with people goes away. In fact, home schooledÂ kids have shown a lack of social skills, and are generally more shy than those who go to public school. Many have even developed psychological disorders such as depression, anxiety, and even a slightly warped perception of reality. Students would be much better off going to a public school and learning from there. 
",3,2,138
B91C344934D2,"Conclusion.If a student is taking a course at home, they aren't being taught by a teacher. Most of the time they are being taught by a computer, video, or their parents.

It's been shown that a majority of students who take online courses or are home schooled tend to score lower on cognition tests than those who go to public school.

With online learning students can explore the internet and other sources to find all sorts of information on a topic. In classrooms, teachers have a teaching method they use and just have to hope it works for everybody. In online learning, there is several ways of learning like watching a video, reading notes, and using a review game. Online learning would allow students to use each method and whatever they think helps them best they can use.

The electoral college is a process, not a place. the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. But it is also a bad thing because you help choose your states electors when you vote for president because when you vote for president because when you vote for your canadate you are actually voting for your canadates electors.

BA117C57D525,"Conclusion.I can counter that the certainty of the vote is false due to the fiasco of Gore and Bush in 2000, as well as the concept of the House of Representatives that I mentioned earlier as well. In the factor that Posner mentioned in his point of everyone's president, I do not find this very accurate due to the reason that our vote relies on a slate of electors, not us entirely, as it would in a popular vote. In swing states, it mentions in the article of Plumer that a winner-takes-all method is unfair to voters because electors ignore states that they do not have confidence in winning the vote. A major point that I disagree with would be the point that Posner pointed out with Big States, where he mentioned that,""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution..."" (3). In this, I would argue that this is unfair, because of the inequality of representatives due to population, which is not the voter's decision. In the statement of Avoid Run-off Elections, Posner states that, ""The Electoral College avoids that problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast"" (3). I find this false due to the reason that the Electoral College is based on a different amount of voters and electors in each state, which in turn is viewed unfair because there is a factor of the swing states once again, explains that some electors choose states over another which lets us show how unfair the Electoral College is, generally speaking.

C3C4D847175E,"Conclusion.Thats why in the Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. There are about 538 electors, now that's alot of people if you ask me. Only 270 of the electoral votes is required to elect the President which is an okay amount of votes for the President election.

C44019DF831B,"Conclusion.Many teenagers today have to take drivers ed classes as they attempt to obtain a license from the BMV. But what would future generation drivers have to go through for their driving exams if we have driverless cars. As stated before, driverless cars aren't entirely driverless. The newer generations still have to learn to basics of driving even if they will be driving in a driverless car in the future. If this does not happen, then they could be in trouble if their driverless cars malfunction or they are forced to drive a regular car instead. The future generations will probably not know about the driving basics because they will think they are too far advanced for it. For example, not many people know how to drive ""stick"" or even know what that means even though it was vital for driving long ago. If someone were to enter a car that needed that kind of function, they would not know what to do. And the same thing applies to future generations if they would not know the driving basics. ",3,2,180
C4804C3EEBD7,"Conclusion.because there could be problems over the outcome of an Electoral College, the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. A candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. Voters in toss-up are more likely to pay close intention to the campaign, knowing that they are going to decide the election. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the vote cast. It also restores some weight in the political balance. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. The Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. ",3,1,147
C4804C3EEBD7,"Conclusion.Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electoral. Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. Your states Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. Voters can expect close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. Under the electoral college system, voters don't vote for the president, but for electors, who in turn elect the president. The electors can be anyone not holding public office. The person who picks the electors in the first place depends on the state ",3,0,115
C4804C3EEBD7,"Conclusion.The argument against the electoral college is what we might call disaster factor. If there is a tie in the electoral vote, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Because each state casts only one vote. the electoral college is unfair to voters, because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, they only focus on the right races in the swing states. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote the party's nominee, but it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Elecotral college is widely regarded as an person or a thing that seems to belong to the past and not to fit in the present, it's a non- demogratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receive most popular votes the winner. ",3,1,171
C48AEB2F1FC2,"Conclusion.The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the electoral college methodis not democratic in a modern sense, it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate, youre actually voting for a slate of electors.

The electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Your states entitled alottment of electors equals the number of its congressional delegation: one for each member in the house of representatives plus 2 for each senator. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidates political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected & what their responsibilities are. ",3,0,134

C492123F426E,"Conclusion.This safety is both for the environment, and most importantly for the drivers of these cars. Indeed, these cars are as safe as they ever will be. We are reminded of the safety of these cars when paragraph eight reminds us that, ""In this way, the in-car system is actually a saftey feature, and saftey is a big concern,"" Not only is the in-car heads-up display a safty feature as it talks about, but reminds us that saftey is the biggest concern that the companies have. This paragraph even mentions how some of the ""fun"" features are for the saftey of the driver, mainly to keep them awake and alert at the wheel even if they are not the drivers. Knowing that saftey is one of the bigest concerns that the companies have for these cars sould be settling because consumers know that the automated cars that they buy would be in top conditions and have a multitude of features that keep both themselves and the passangers safe. One of the many features mentioned was the voice or even a vibrating chair to signal when the car needs a human to control the driving because the road needs the expertise of a human driver. Because these cars are safe, their development is very positive. ",3,2,216
C4B52CBE6186,"Conclusion.Another claim that the face is actually a land form and was not created by aliens is that in paragraph twelve is it giving us a very clear and precise meaning that the Face is an landform by telling us that, "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. ""That a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

C5162A975732,"Conclusion.Is distance learning through video and online conferencing a great and beneficial way for students to learn from home or does it hinder one's chances of actually learning and having a good learning experience? Video conferencing is widely used in today's society as technology has boosted and upgraded. People often use video conferencing as a means to chat, have meetings and most importantly, educational purposes such as having class online. Many may claim that video conferencing through distance learning is a good thing because it gives students adequate time to spend time with family and have time for their jobs as well while taking classes online ",4,2,107

C5162A975732,"Conclusion.Secondly, video conferencing with distance learning from home is not advisable and great because it brings distractions ",0,2,18
C5162A975732,"Conclusion.some students that often take online courses may get bored because they're constantly staring at a screen, so taking online classes starts to get boring for them and they start to get lazy and refrain from doing their work, students do that because they're constantly staring at a screen which starts to give eye problems. sitting behind a screen for prolonged hours causes problems for the eyes such as watery eyes and pain in the eye, sometimes eye twitches which make learning frustrating. So as a result, students stop doing their work. Whereas in a school building, students are not always looking at screens but white boards also which is less harmful to the eyes. Students are not lazy because classes ring from bell to bell, so students are always up and moving rather that sitting behind a computer all day. It's best to go to school without being lazy and staying healthy rather than using a video conference to learn. ",3,2,162
C5162A975732,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion, video conferencing and taking online classes with distance learning is not the best thing for students, because of the conflict and problems that come with it. It can greatly affect a student's education. With online classes, students may be faced with distractions which can cause them to stay off task and bring down their grades leading to frustration and depression. This can lead to suicidal thoughts and drain a student's life. Health is very important, and it is necessary that our bodies should be healthy. Taking online courses can have a negative and tragic effect on a student's body leading to eye problems, the eye being a very important body part. This may eventually let the student become unproductive and lazy. Also many students prefer having a face to face teaching session to make learning more efficient and better to understand overall. Students across the world should be able to learn the importance of physically being in school where there's plenty of teachers and resources around. Being in school is very important and can greatly benefit students. Technological advancements in the modern world is also very important and have been beneficial in helping with education and making education better. But students should not let the technology of today make them lazy and they should be willing to work hard and diligently.   Â  Â  Â    Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â  ",1,2,225

This shows how John shifted from some mysterious guy to a possible trusted friend, all because of a personal connection. Schools offer this same opportunity with students and teachers, but online classes eliminate this opportunity. The online connection of a student and teacher is significantly reduced due to never seeing them or having any personal interactions ",3,2,86
C579A4D6151E,"Conclusion.One example of this is ""Impractical Jokers,"" which is a show of four life-long friends who met in high school, and compete to do extreme and comical activities in public. This show shows us that these four friends developed social skills in high school and became closer due through school. If any of those guys took online classes instead, the chances of them being friends still in their forties would not be as high. Attending school in person is very important because it forces people to be social and make friends and not hide behind a computer, which a virtual class would allow. ",3,2,105
C579A4D6151E,"Conclusion.Another example of this is Clemson's star quarterback, Trevor Lawrence. Him and his girlfriend have been together for years since high school, and he is now one year from entering the NFL. If he had chosen to attend classes from home instead, he would most likely not be with, or even know his current girlfriend. This shows that attending a real school is very beneficial, especially in the social aspect. Creating social skills and developing character is very important to do at a young age, and is difficult to do so while attending a class behind a computer monitor. ",3,2,100

CBC776495BE0,"Conclusion.The world we live in now compared to the 1800s is very different. We've upgraded, not only in our inventions, but our states as well. The electoral college was made when America was first established because it was fit for the needs of that time. The Office of Federal Register states, ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" Back then, it was needed to balance things out among the 13 colonies. In those times, we didn't have the advance techonology we have now to see our candidates on screens or in person. Since then, we've turned 13 colonies into 50 states, turned horses into cars, and small radios into televisions. Rules and laws change to fit the current needs all the time. The electoral college should do the same. Due to the fact this system has been around since the founding fathers, major mistakes occur ",3,2,174

There is also the point in Plumer's article about the time Hawaii sent two slates, which forced the desicion to Nixon, who had to validate only the opponet's votes in fear of otherwise receiving bad publicity. There is also the strange way of resolving a tie, which boils down to the same thing as the winner-take-all system, except if more people supportÂ  it doesn't matter. It would be like if everybody in theÂ  room wasn't alowed to vote, other than one voted, but everybody in the room agreed anyway for some strange, miraculous reason.

CF43485AE351,Conclusion.including aiding students in maintaining their health ,0,0,8
CF43485AE351,"Conclusion.However, there is no way for them to remain home and keep up with schoolwork. This fear of being unable to attend school and still keeping up with their course loadÂ is one that plagues many students. Personally speaking, I can reference numerous students who have felt dangerously ill on school days, but were so afraid of missing tests and presentations that they still came. They felt that if they even missed one day, they would have missed salient lessons, causing their work to pile up, resulting in stress. Providing an alternate method for these students to learn, such as online classes, would have mitigated their concerns. This logic pertains to mental health as well. It is common knowledge that the mental health of adolescents in this generation is declining, and the most prominent reason is school. Online classes provide an avenue for students who feel their mental health is worsening to still receive an education but from a place of comfort, which is their home. ",3,2,167
CF43485AE351,"Conclusion.For example, if a student's schedule is comprised of Algebra II, Biology, US History, and English Language and Composition, if the student is strong in math, he or she will likely speed through the course, allotting more time to the other subjects. If the online classes are based upon pace, students can get through subjects quicker, rather than being forced to remain in a class for an hour and a half. This results in students having more time to engage in the activities they are passionate about while having more flexible schedules. Why is this significant? Well, for example, places like INOVA have volunteer programs for kids to help senior citizens that require people to work from 12 pm-3 pm on weekdays. A regular student could not possibly participate in that program, regardless of how passionate he or she is about helping the elderly. Alternatively, if a student had an idea for a groundbreaking research project that he or she must complete in a lab, the student could devote more time to developing their procedure and collecting data than before. Attending school in person, regularly, will likely be an obstacle for these students, as a nearly 8 hour long school day with four hours of homework and mandatory extracurriculars does not leave sufficient time for the students to pursue their dreams ",3,2,222
CF43485AE351,"Conclusion.but that is information we will likely never know, as they are not permitted the time necessary to explore their interests. Perhaps there are many students with innovative ideas for research projects that lack the time for it. With the addition of online school, students might be able to devote more time to discovering their interests and pursuing them.

Personally, the driverless cars just seem to have too many negative qualities to be worth production. ",1,0,97
D1ACADAC5ED4,"Conclusion.Many students come into school even if they are sick. This causes an illness to spread around the entire student body just because one student couldn't miss class. On the other hand, if a student stays home because they are sick, they miss a lot of classwork and aren't able to pay attend the important lessons being taught. One time, I had to stay home because of a stomach bug. I got behind in my classes and was never really able to understand the concepts as well as I could have if I was taught by my teacher like everyone else. I got a very bad grade on the test on these concepts because I was not able to catch up. If I was able to call in to my missed classes, I would have benefited greatly because I could ask questions if I had any, hear the teacher's explanation, and see how the teacher would solve the problem instead of having to figure it all out on my own. On a more serious level, there are some kids who are, unfortunately, terminally ill. They are either physically unable to go to school because of their type of illness or aren't allowed to go out very often because of the risks and dangers they could face. They are more prone to your typical cold and flu, and it is deadlier for them. If they were able to sit in on their classes through a video conference, then they could still feel like they are going to high school like a ""normal"" teenager. Overall, even if attending classes online was only available to those who are sick, it would still help so many kids. ",3,2,284

The electoral college is responsible for picking electors, who can go behind the peoples back and chose the president nobody wanted. This system or process is a total disaster.

There is a example

Al Gore he won the popular vote but not the presidency .And that majority would have preferred a direct election.

Schools have only served to increase instances of bullying through zero-tolerance policies, in which the victim is punished equally as much as the aggressor. This also leads to students being afraid to report bullying, as they would also risk punishment. Distance learning would reduce bullying by putting ""distance"" between a bully and a victim of bullying.

Someone trying to help us move forward or someone making our tax money got to the people who dont want to get off there lazy butt and do something. I do not know 100% of the facts on who can vote or not, but if a bum sitting on state road 70 all day begging for money just so he can go buy beer, seems unfair that he should even get a vote. In my opinion half of the population will end up voting for someone because, of what bad benefits he is offering and then we will be stuck with another bad president for another 4 years! Who knows more about congress then our congress? Lets be a honest here, do we really want all our tax money going to families with 8 kids and cant afford 2 or the bums on the side of the road begging for money or the trashy people hitting up crack ever time they get a little bit of money? Not me! ",3,1,192
D8ED809B7F92,"Conclusion.I dont think that matters because why would they vote for someone who isnt fit to be president? If they are even up there, they are fit. So I think the Electoral College is just fine of a process to use for the United States of America. ",6,0,48

D97A2C636D38,"Conclusion.Another reason the Electoral Collage is unfair is because the electors might all be Republican or all Democrat but we as voters dont get a chance to pick what party we stand for, with popular vote you have a chance to say who you want and what party you represent weather its Republican, Democrat or Induvial you at least get the chance and even though its only a 25 percentÂ  chance who you vote for is going to win at least its still a chance.

D97A2C636D38,"Conclusion.Popular vote has its many advantges but one of the best is you can ""get to know"" who your voting for the canidates can come to your state and make speechs, have posters something to tell you what they are planning on doing if they get elected, this gives every state a fair chance to see who they are voting for. And yes they might spend a longer time in New york then Ohio but at least their spending time and educating the people on what they want to do and why the people should vote for them. ",3,0,99
D9900BD19D55,"Conclusion.To begin with, every candidate is running for President for your state ,and each of them has their own electors .

After every four years presidential election is held on tuesday after the first monday ,

the fun part is that most states gets a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all the electors to the winning presidential candidate ,

also your governer prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment""

listing all the wonderful candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors .

This year most voters are expecting another close election in the population vote which winners could again lose the presidency.

Under electoral college system some voters don't vote for presidents but vote for a state of electors , if you lived in texas for an example and wanted to vote for someone named John kerry you would vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry .

For the winner-take-all method of the award electoral votes induces the candidates just like in 2012 election .Obama won the vote and got 29 electoral votes ,a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in the campaign

Nixton in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had a 43 pecent plurality of popular votes ",3,1,205

D9B5F55E6705,"Conclusion.But first, what is the Electoral College anyways? Well, the Electoral College is not an actual college, its actually a process. The Founding Fathers made it as ""a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress, and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens"", as stated in paragraph one of the article, lines 3-6. A somewhat tedious task to get voted for a whole entire country, but it gets the job done. ",3,0,80

The people who studies online or at home are more intelligent, and learn more because they are concentrate in what they are doing. In sometimes in the schools they are not concentrate because they are playing or talking with their friends and that can distract people. If they make a competition an student who studied on line or at home with one student is a regular school I think the student is not on the school can win because sometimes that students are more prepared then the regular school. Also sometime the students who go to a regular school they just go for play with their friends is good to have some friends but they are not concentrate o they are sleeping when the teacher is explaining and then when they do the exam or quiz they fail.

I have no idea what they would think about the change to the policy that might be possible to be changing when you can only participate in sports or other activities like clubs and all the other stuff. My friend of mine told me she has a C average in one class and the rest she has like a B average she think she does. She also told me if it does change she would say she don't like the policy being changed. Because she said some students wont liked it any way. She bets some would at least like the idea of changed it to have least a B average. My other friends of mine don't want it to change.

DB9CAE4A0E72,"Conclusion.In today's society, things are growing and changing at a rapid rate. There are new technological advances and new ideas and innovations that come into this world everyday. One particular subject that comes in mind is the idea of online courses. These courses are mainly for people who do not have easier access or any type of transportation to school which can lead to be very useful. People love this idea and innovation of school and think students could genuinely benefit from this. Undoubtedly, there are a lot of flaws to this, the one major problem that stands out the most is it could cause students to take advantage of these online courses and cheat by using another browser to look up their answer's and could lead to long-term consequences.

DB9CAE4A0E72,"Conclusion.Unlike online courses, teachers can observe students during their classwork and exam to see if they are cheating or not. For example, a teacher can watch you in person and closely, but the teacher through the screen can only see what you show and not your full body as in person. This shows that cheating could be a major key flaw to online courses and shows that it does not very well help a student learn or understand in any way possible. In fact, it does the opposite of that. Undoubtedly, online courses are subject to very likely cheating and does not prepare students for any type of further learning after high schoo ",3,0,114
DB9CAE4A0E72,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion, online course do not benefit students because gaining an in-person experience with teachers can help a student learn better from their mistakes on certain types of questions. They also do not benefit students by having more of a likely chance to cheat during exams online. Because of this, this does not prepare students for further growth of knowledge if they want to continue to do school after high school. The final reason students do not benefit from online courses is that students need friends in person because that is what makes them have a good childhood and become a better person based of off their opinions. To conclude, online courses are not a way to help students at all during this day and age. It has too many flaws that can not be fixed unfortunately. A lot of things are growing in this society, but this should not grow any further. ",1,2,155

DBACBF67A45C,"Conclusion.An example of one of my concerns is weather or not the car will be able to tell when school hours are active or when work zones are near by. The text states, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This example makes one flaw with the designe of the car, and thats the fact that what if the car doesn't get the update that the danger zone is near and never alerts the driver.

DC5BDFA3BFD6,"Conclusion.These learning environments surround students by other peers and encourage debates, understandings, and protests. The benefits may seem negative, but in these events students start to bounce ideas off of each other and grow in thought processing. Students will attract those who agree with their views and form bonds, creating comfort in the classroom for them. It is easy to feel alone when you don't understand a topic, but it can be valuable to have that other person there in the class who doesn't quite get the same problem you don't. You can collaborate, put together what you both know, and come up with a solution. this not only provides for better learning, but provides children with the social skills they will need for life.

It is provided so that students of different learning paces can have different method options as to which best fits their area of learning. There is something for everyone, whether it be independent teachings, one-on-one time with teachers, or staying in the classroom.

At the most basic level,the electoral college is unfair to voters because it's a winners takes all system. The electoral colllege consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect your president. The elctoral college is anachronism and it's time we should be open minded and look in to the future and rely on the Americans votes we should not rely on 538 people to vote for the millions of people we have in America.

E39559BF14F2,"Conclusion.Both mental and physical illnesses come with a unique everyday battle, for the individuals who suffer from them. Some students suffer from mental illness's like: PTSD, Anxiety, Bipolar, and Depression. When a student suffers from a mental illness and attends a public school it can be extremely difficult to cope. Depression is a mental illness that affects someones thoughts and feelings to occur as more negative. In some cases, depression can affect someone physically. Someone who suffers from depression and attends a public school can face daily difficulties, like, getting out of bed in the morning for school and participating in class. When I was in the eighth grade, I had to transfer out of my public school, Generic_School. I transferred out of Generic_School and instead received my eighth grade education through online classes. I took online classes from home. Attending Generic_School was a difficult responsibility for me at the time because I was in a very depressive state of mind. When taking online classes and being home schooled, I had plenty of extra time to slowly pull myself out of the depressiveÂ mindset that I was suffering from. I pulled myself out of this depressive mindset, by using my extra time going to therapy and receiving medication to improve the negative thoughts and feelings that I had towards myself and life. Online classes benefited me because I learned all of the eighth grade circular that I needed to at a pace that was comfortable for me and my mentalÂ health at the time.

E39559BF14F2,"Conclusion.Some children have busier and more complicated lives compared to others. For example, some children are raised in households that their parent guardian struggles financially. When a child is raised into a financially struggling household, he or she will busy themselves by working a full-time job. A child who is raised into a household like this will work full-time because they will do anything it takes for them to be financially stable on their own in their future. A child who works a full-time job, typically doesn't have enough time out of his or hers day to attend a public school. But, he or she will have the opportunity of having extra time to prepare themselves for their future. In a hypothetical situation like this, online classes and video conferencing from home would be very beneficialÂ to students who are born into households were they have no choice but to busy themselves and to be an independent because they can't be dependent on their parent guardian.

E4FC29A88EDD,Conclusion.Paragraph 8 discusses making the driving fun by entertaining them. Whereas Paragraph 7 is about the driver taking over and the different functions to make them aware. The key to having the person aware of the dangerous situation is to not have them distracted in the first place. Plus that prevents any accidents if flaws in the warning system should occur. The reason there is a long lasting trust in human judgement on the road is that the people have a chance to take action quick enough. If they were not previously paying attention due to the driverless car then that chance is wasted by them attempting to figure out what the situation is in the first place. Eliminate the possibilty of that irresponsible lack of attention by having the person drive to begin with. ,3,2,136
E4FC29A88EDD,"Concluding Statement.Driverless cars would allow too many flaws in the system and legality issues that prevent them for obtaining the title of a safter option. The manufacturers are attempting to make a car that is easier and requires less effort, but in doing so there is a plethora of issues that accompany it. The question of who is legally to blame for issues would waste time and money. During the process of development, the producers are accepting accidents as a given fact instead of trying to produce a flawless car. They are also focusing on the idea of a ""entertaining car"" instead of one that keeps the passengers alert for possible accidents. Therefore, there are too many arguments for safety against the vehicles to even consider mass producing them. The driverless cars are much safer on the big screen than in reality. ",1,2,143
E504081AA343,"Conclusion.In many countries most children do not have a choose of whether or they want to up out the community.

The office states "" the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their resposibilities are"". In this statement the Office is stating on how whichever party a person might be in, the electoral college will come through.

The bell signals and the sound of shuffling papers and zipping bags begins as people pack up for their next class. The teacher bids farewell as their students trickle out the door into the busy hallway. StudentsÂ chat as they meander to their next classroom. Settling down, they pull out their notebooks for their lesson. The teacher begins, interacting with them and receiving questions. While this seems like a standard snippet of a high school experience, there are many factors that would be lost if school began allowing the use of distance learning ",4,2,95
E85C45D90D1D,"Conclusion.Through distance learning, students would be unable to retain scheduled attention ",0,0,12
E85C45D90D1D,"Conclusion.First of all, classrooms have a live, and trained teacher. Students are able to learn from someone that they get to know throughout the year. Interaction is easy with both the teacher, and with other students in the room. With a live teacher, the learner can ask and answer questions easily and receive personal attention concerning their individual issues with topics or assignments. This factor helps students maintain focus as they are able to quickly resolve confusion and the teacher can alert them if they begin to zone out or get distracted ",3,2,93
E85C45D90D1D,"Conclusion.Secondly, a schedule is very important in maintaining a balanced day. Having classes aligned for the week can enable students to practice time management and help them be alert for appropriate times throughout each day. To my friend, having a schedule is extremely important. Without one, she gets concerned that she will not be able to accomplish what needs to get done. To combat this fear, she creates lists, with scheduled times, that allow her align her personal schedule with her tasks. Similarly to my friend, students need to able to see what they need to learn in that day and get it done. They can work on getting to class on time, and due to breaks and meals throughout the day, they can relax knowing that their time is planned out for them. This ability is lost when students make choices as to when they feel like taking their online or video conference classes ",3,2,156
E85C45D90D1D,"Conclusion.Lastly, the school environment is made for learning. Classrooms have helpful posters and worksheets that guide students in their learning. The walls are usually soundproofed, and teachers help to prevent distractions. This setup is in direct contrast to a home environment. Also, being present in the classroom helps to prevent technology malfunctions and poor connection that could be disruptive or deteriorate the student's ability to learn. ",3,2,67

The whole point of even having a president is to control and keep the United States Of America happy. Why do the oppisite? If the people are happy, and there is a comander in cheif, then its a win win situation. Every ones happy. The whole point. Why would anyone try to mess that up and change things causing chaos and unhappiness? I thought it was for the people not aginst the people.

E9826DEAFF5F,"Conclusion.The electoral college consists of many electorals. They consist of 538 electorals. Majority of the electoral votesare 270, which is required to elect the President. Under the 23rd Admendment of the Constitution, the District of Cloumbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state on purposes of the Electoral College.

Each canidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors.

Afte the presidential election, your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment "" listing all of the candidates who ran for President n your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential canidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year.

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but forr aslate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Kerry,you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democtratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election,they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes.

It can be argues that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candiate who has no hope of carrying their state-Democrats on Texas,for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked up by popular vote. ",3,1,270
E98F49492C8B,Conclusion.Maybe if you let them more people will listen and not get in as much trouble. ,0,1,17
E98F49492C8B,Conclusion.If people start to listen then well people won't get suspended as much. Now if you choose the second policy then people will not listen and bring there phones to school and you would just be suspending kids who just brought their phone to school. You would have a lot more suspicions or detentions. ,3,0,55

E9BB013E0F33,Conclusion.Gravin states that it reminds her\him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. ,4,1,17
E9BB013E0F33,Conclusion.It might be from the Earths winds pushing the sand over and making it look like it a face. It also could be the gravitation pull of the Earth. I think that you should believe that is not aliens because if it was aliens dont you thinl they would be doing more than just that? That means if it reall the aliens who made this they must have a lot of thinking and knowledge about stuff like that. That also means that when earth moves the face moves with the Earth. Does this have anything to do with the man in the moon? ,3,1,104
E9BB013E0F33,Concluding Statement.People probably think that it is made by aliens because people don't go to Mars. People that go to Mars have to be very brave and other things too. the camera has taken pictures because it has to have proof that it really does look like a face. I think again that it is just a landform that has been made over the pass years by the gratational pull and Earths winds.       ,1,0,74
E9C3211DC772,Conclusion.I would rather want the changing of the election to popular vote because the Electoral college process causes many promblems ,5,0,21

E9D72176CA9A,"Conclusion.For example, two schools in an area have their 8th grade students do at least an hour of community service a day. Eventually, people would forget how nice it is because it would become a usual thing around the town. This shows that if everyone in 8th grade performed community service daily, or even weekly, citizens would view it as the students doing what they need to do, rather than how nice those students are. ",3,2,76
E9D72176CA9A,"Conclusion.If all 8th graders had to do it then it would not bring out the best in them and would be dreaded by some.

Supporting this, the whole 8th grade of 120 students have to do an hour of community service a day. 40 out of the 120 do not like the labor and dread it, causing them to have the thought of community service in their heads the whole day. This would cause changes in attitudes throughout daily life . In addition, it would lead to bad attitudes towards helping the community and bad habits for the future. ",3,2,99
EA1D34C41DE6,"Conclusion.and presidents cannot be elected by a region alone. 
",0,0,10
EA1D34C41DE6,Conclusion.if there was only popular vote then presidential candidates could waste their time on smaller states when they could of been winning larger states. ,3,1,25
EA1D34C41DE6,Conclusion.This means that if a particular reigion favors a candidate they cannot win by only a single regions votes. This makes the candidates campaign less in regions that are more likely to be won and more in other regions. But with the Electoral College this makes it harder for a candidate with only regional appeal to win because other regions feel like their votes will not be as effective towards the election. With popular vote a presidential candidate will not know where to campaign and where not because there is no winner take all method. ,3,0,96

Usually when you use the popular demand process one state might get more attention then another state, where as Electoral College process will treat each and every state equally. When using the Electoral College process it would be easier to count up the votes because you only have so many voters, where as with the popular demand process there would have to be over 2 million votes counted up.

F00FF00D5C8F,"Conclusion.In the 2000 presidential race, Al Gore lost because he recieved the most popularity votes from the people but the electoral college voted for Bush instead(Source 2). This means that the people thought Al Gore should be the president but instead they didn't get what they wanted because the electoral college thought otherwise. Do you think this is in anyway fair? The majority of the country ended up unhappy with the election because of ther electoral college. I say that alone is enough reason to abolish the electoral college. If it happens once it can happen again. Do you want to feel cheated and betrayed again? Let's get rid of the electoral college! ",3,2,114
F00FF00D5C8F,"Conclusion.It is still possible to have a tie though because there are 538 total votes and since that is an even number then it can happen. And if there is just a stlight difference and instead the electoral college creates a landslide then that isn't representing the actuall number of the votes by the people. Once again you are being cheated out of your sya it the election. The hardest thing to understand is why people would still support something that doesn't support them. The electoral college basically throws away your votes and replaces them with theirs. And once again, it is possible for ties in the electoral college due to the even number of votes. ",6,2,117
F00FF00D5C8F,"Conclusion.""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much to say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters.""(Source 2). This alone shows that your votes are being represented equally. It is saying that 500,000 votes are equal to 35 million votes. Isn't it obvious that those two numbers are very different and they could have a very large effect on the popularity of each canidate that they are voting for? but instead they have they same effect and the 34.5 million voters that don't get their fair say could very possibly be unhappy with the turnout of the president. The people are supposed to be the ones that vote for their leader, not a group of 538 ""qualified"" polititians that can over rule the entire country's vote. ",3,2,146
F00FF00D5C8F,Conclusion.There are supporters who say that they support the electoral college because it avoids run-off elections. Because even if there is a tie in the majority votes from the people it is unlikey for there to be a tie in the votes from the electoral college. ,2,2,47
F00FF00D5C8F,"Conclusion.In my opinion if there is a tie in the popularity votes then they should revote, it may take longer but it will still be a decision by the people. Just because it makes the procces faster doesnt mean it makes the procces better. They can create a better system in the event of a tie instead of electors over ruling the people and picking whoever they think is best. That isnt government for the people, by the people. ",6,2,80
F00FF00D5C8F,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion, the electoral college needs to be extinguished for many reasons. those reasons are because it doesn't let the people vote for who they want and it over rules a notions votes. And because it doesnt show the number of votes as equall. Some may say that it is good because it prevents a tie but if there is a tie then I'm sure htere are better ways to revote. we need government for the people, by the people and that isn't what the electoral college is.

Even students that were invested in an after schoolÂ activity before a switch to online schooling occurred would face the difficulty in their ability to travel to the new meeting place of their activity. Many students do not have access to a car, either for financial or legal reasons (they do not have a license yet), so busing is the only way these students are able to travel to and from the school. With online schooling this busing would no longer be consistent and many after schoolÂ activities would see huge drops in participation or fold entirely.

Online schooling would only magnify the problem by allowing problems to go undetected with the school having limited access to what is going on only when students are logged into a computer. The second problem arises from the transition that students make from high schoolÂ to college. This serves as a difficult time for students already withÂ hazing, bullying, and other bad social behaviors occurring. If a student is sheltered for all of their public education, from kindergarten to 12th grade, they are exposed to this harsh environment without the social skills or experience required to navigate these turbulent times. Instead of stopping the problem of bulling, online education only seeks to kick the problem further down the road. ",3,2,142

It has come to a point where students feel unprotected in a place where their parents and teachers may think they feel safe. School is portrayed as a safe environment and should be. Although, in some situations it is not and many students have dealt with bullying in a learning environment. Bullying makes it difficult for any student to come to school focused and feel comfortable with who they are.

F1A0D1F81017,"Conclusion.In tedious situations like a traffic jam, driving is boring and energy wasting.

However, driverless cars can take away the exhausting driving experience and allow the driver to relax.

For example, ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" will be very helpful to anyone in a traffic jam because it would take away the boredom of driving in a traffic jam.

Traffic Jam Assistant enables the car to handle driving functions up to 25 miles per hour.

This would be very helpful in a long and tedious traffic jam because one does not drive over 25 miles per hour in a traffic jam.

Also, if taxis could be driverless cars, the quality of life for the average citizen would increase.

Taxis would cost less money, they would be open more often, and they could take passengers to farther destinations.

This would dramatically increase the quality of life for all people and it would make owning a car almost antiquated.

F1C9FEFF073B,"Conclusion.Most states have a ""winner-takes-all"" system (with the exception ofMaine and Nebraska) that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate in their state.(source 1) There may be an arguement that no state has enough votes to give the presidency to someone; however, this system basically casts away the other votes of those on the side of the opposing candidate, making it undemocratic.

When the election results are in the hands of the House, the selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.

State legislatures are responsible for picking electors and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.

Kennedy thus proving that the electorial college cannot be trusted. Another reason why the electorial college is unfair to the people is because of the winner-takes-all system in each state due to the candidates not being in the state and focus only on the race between ""swing"" states.

F68A995107BE,"Conclusion.The journey to school is different for every student.

This situation could prevent a child from attending a public school at all, or make it very difficult to attend everyday. The family shouldn't have to move from the house they love for their children to attend school. The distance learning program would be able to fix this situation. Fortunately for the family, with the distance learning program, the student would be able to video conference the schools from the comfort of their home. Personally, I know a program like this would benefit families like my cousins family who lives far out of the way and struggles to drive to school every morning because public school transportation does not go far enough to reach where they live. This program would take the stress off the family and continue to allow the student to attend public school. ",3,2,182

F737FB396F2E,"Conclusion.For Example:

some people that are here in the United States they have to go to school and work after school, and they got to pay rent, send money to their families back in there Contries.

For Example:

Some of the people don't have someone that can take them to school and the school is far away that the buses can not go all the way to their homes.

For Example:

There are some kids that don't go to school, having the school next to them, but there's alot of people out here thet would love to go to school or even take online classes but they can't because some of them are always working, some of them even have two jobs.

For Example: My mom wouold loved to take online classes at less but she can't because she has to work in the very morning like at 7 am, and she comes back like at one she cleans the house and then like at 3pm she goes to her other job and she gets out like at 11:30 pm so she doesn't have time but she would love if she could do it.

For Example: My dad he's going all the way to DC for school because he is taking classes for duster he pays each moth and my dad works to in countruction but weekends she goes to DC the classes start like at 10 and they end like at 1, if you like someting work hard for what you like.

For Example: I have a friend that he takes online he work's everyday, he takes his computer to his work so when he's on break runs to the computer and he starts school online like that someone that wants to progress in this country.Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  ",3,1,298
F739195A9518,"Conclusion.it creates the possibility for students to take advantage of the freedom, ",0,0,13
F739195A9518,"Conclusion.For example, to the student at home, his or her own grade is the highest, as it is the only point of comparison for him or her. However, at school, academic competition among peers allows for students to push themselves outside of their comfort zone, achieving their highest potentials. Additionally, the motivation of a student who takes classes from home is less than that of a student in a classroom as students at school are more exposed to the opportunities that other students have taken advantage of, such as sports and extracurriculars. This allows a student in school become motivated to simply engage in more activities and accomplish more in his or her fields of interest. The interaction that school promotes creates motivation among students and allows them to engage in healthy competition, while accomplishments more in their academic career. 
",3,2,141
F739195A9518,"Concluding Statement.Distance learning, the concept of making at-home classes an option for students, is unsupported due to the fact that it does not promote the same motivation as a classroom, allows students to take advantage of their freedoms at home, and does not allow student's to develop their interpersonal skills. These factors would negatively influence a student's academic success, which is irrefutably counter-intuitive to the intended purpose of educational institutions.Â  ",1,2,71
F744ABAAC3FB,"Conclusion.Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO, in their time , agreed on? Abolishing the electoral college. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.

Who picks the electors? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central comittee, sometimes the presidentail canidates themselves. Voters can't controls whom their electors vote for. Well not always .Voters sometimes get very confused about the votes in vote for the wrong canidate.

The best arguement against the electoral college is called Disater Factor. The Americans should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election in a century. Back in 1960, segregations in Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratics with new electors that would oppose John F. Kennedy.

The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the canidates who recieve the most votes. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, it happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over popular vote.

The Electoral College requires a presidential Canidate to have trans-regional appeal. No other region ( South, Northwest, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes. The electoral College avoids the problems of elections in which no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. For an example, nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes.       Â Â Â  ",3,1,278

Does that mean we should go with the popular votes if it's a tie? Yes, well if it's an even number it happens rarely enough where you don't see it often. ""Voters are the people who want to expressÂ rather than people who think a single vote will decide."" The people eho think one vote will decide more than the other's is wrong because what if that person had expressed their vote and the other choice would've won. ",3,1,119

Abolishing the electoral college!

they're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election to the kind we have now.

It also states that the presidental candidates can also vote for the electors not just the people and the state.Â  But what is not fair, is that the voters can not always control who the electors vote for.Â  The citizens should be able to vote for the president they want.Â  The man or woman they want to run their country.

FBE13E9A446C,"Conclusion.If we can't repair or replace the fabric that is our Electoral College, soon there will be problems too big for us to deal with in our current state. The electoral voters may keep the public in mind for now, but there have already been cases where electoral voters put their own wants ahead of the public. ",3,2,58
FBE13E9A446C,"Conclusion.One thing that the Electoral College does not promote is the power in the hands of the people. Although people can vote for whatever candidate they want, the elector is the real deciding hand in the process of picking our president. ",0,2,42
FBE13E9A446C,"Conclusion.If one wanted to, an elector can completely disregard the decision of the voters and choose who they want. Considering the ratio of electors in some states to people, it seems completely non-democratic for the votes of some to be more important than the wants of the common people. Some start to feel that they shouldn't vote because their one vote wouldn't have the power to change anything, and wouldn't even ensure the election of the president they want. Another thing that lowers the morale is the absence of candidates in states that can't be won very easily. If a candidate is pretty sure he can't win over a state, he won't visit it because it wouldn't be worth his time. He also wil prioritize large states over small ones because they have more electoral votes. All of these can make a state or person feel as if the election isn't really in their hands, and when people feel like their vote doesn't matter, they don't vote. ",3,2,168

FEF2E1612F55,"Conclusion.First of all, What is the electoral college? The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

By talking to multiple people exploring new thoughts and mindsets, getting an unbiased opinion, and being able to express and organize your thoughts you are getting set up to make good choices rationally.

Personally, when I am stuck in a situation I try to ask more than one person for advice, because like I explained it can be very beneficial.

When there is peer involvement, there is growth in the character and intelligence of the person. This kind of negative influence on students also adds to the very limited learning experience online. Most of the learning factors that make a well rounded student are not present. For example, the interaction between a teacher and a student will be blunt and simple instead of a face-to-face learning experience. Peer discussions are also limited because there might not be any time for an in depth discussion like there would be in a regular classroom. Peer involvement builds relationships that influence learning in a healthy environment. These normal student acts will be limited if the classes are based in online servers instead of the classroom.

I decided to take this class for the following reasons: to experience online school and see if it was adequate for me and to get this class done this year so I could focus on more specific subjects my senior year in high school. I started the course through a platform called vision used by Generic_School, which is both an in-school class resource and a online class tool. As far as I have been experiencing this new learning format, I have found many advantages to it. The course i'm enrolled in is self-paced, meaning I can do my work when suggested or work ahead if I have the time, which I have had. This doesn't happen often to me because I always find myself stressed during school hours, not thinking of learning and working ahead, but thinking about the time I can get our of the school's campus and go home. This is something thousands of students in this school had felt or are feeling. I have made a research paper describing how decoration and lighting in a classroom affect significantly the learning process of anyone at any given time. This occurs because many schools, including mine, have pure white lights and walls which can induce anxiety, stress and overtime help mental health problems appear or worsen depending on the person ",3,2,232

Most children know that they can always go to their parents for advice, and they feel safe and comfortable doing so, knowing that something good will come out of discussing the choice and what to do. Choices are also frequently discussed, thought through, then solved with peers. In middle school, most do not have to make any life-changing decisions, but sometimes it can feel like it.

0A6324CE9AD0,"Conclusion.For example, one of the person asked could've had an experience of being on the other side of a similar situation which could help you think what is at risk or what is gained.

0C82FD59BA0B,"Concluding Statement.Due to the lack of a teacher presence and of participation in a classroom, I believe that teens would not benefit from receiving education from home. Without a teacher, who has been trained for years, a student cannot focus on his or her work, and can fall behind other teens who are the same age. And without a personal experience in a classroom, students who take online classes won't be able to learn from mistakes or interact and gain feedback from teachers and peers. Schools were made to be a learning environment for children, so that they can get ready for life after school. But when you stay at home, you don't know how to be prepared. ",1,2,119

0F13AFF35C0C,"Conclusion.Why is it more beneficial to seek multiple opinions when making a decision? When people ask for advice, they are usually conflicted about something, or don't know what to do. The reason that one person asks for advice could be because they don't know what shoes to wear, or it could be because they need advice about something bigger, like what house to buy. Either way, they are still seeking other people's opinions. When you are asking a person for advice, you want a definite answer. You could ask one person for advice about what shoes to wear, and they could say black, and then you could ask someone else for advice about the same thing, and they could say a different answer.

Now you go ask a experienced co-worker he says, "" Your dog can be one of the best things that happened in your life but you have to find the right moment, because if you work to much and cant take care of it its not worth it to you and your dog. Also it is a lot of money and time, you have to pay almost 100 dollars a month just to feed it on top of your time, taking it on walks in the morning, middle of the day, and at night.

However, with distance learning, these distractions would be eliminated.

Technology is a blessing and curse, which means it helps teachers teach but also in certain aspects it worsens the attention span of younger children. Diving deeper into this world-wide technology advancement that is happening, there is this one main question that gets asked quite a lot by administrators all around the world, ""Would students work harder and better if they could attend classes from home virtually online or through video conferencing?"" My full opinion to that is, no. Studies show that almost 97% of people work better in a room full of other peers, although the isolation and focus you may have at your own home is nice and relaxing, in order for a person to fully develop into a knowledgeable student they have to have, social skills, community awareness, and be able to understand eye-to-eye learning.

29687C1F98F1,"Concluding Statement.Although the idea of not attending school and staying at home all day is a dream for many students, it fails to serve the same benefits to students that regular classrooms do. When comparing distance learning to classroom settings, it can be seen that learning in classrooms is a much more beneficial option. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because there would be no face to face interactions with their instructors and peers, there would be no hands-on-learning within their class lessons, and students would not be able to become used to a college setting after participating in distance learning for a long time.

2A4C1A1AD665,"Conclusion.Many people like to see what others think about them, rather it be a new look, or needing guidance in a difficult situation. ",0,2,24
2A4C1A1AD665,"Concluding Statement.If somebody asked only one person their opinion, it would be impossible to get a group's majority. As mentioned in the second paragraph, a majority of people can bring far more reassurance than one person. This can help somebody make better decisions, since there are other people that have examined the situation as their own, and have given thought out advice. As well, it is often a good feeling to somebody, knowing that multiple people acknowledge and care about them. People like when they have not been lied to, because it shows a relationship of trust. Trust can play a big factor, in terms of advice, because a person will not be able to believe other people's ideas, if they can't rely on the person. In conclusion, asking a group of people for advice can lead to different recommendations, an increased sense of relief, and ultimately, making better decisions. At the end of the day, it is important to ask others for advice because people have to make their own decisions. Sometimes it can be extremely hard for people to decide which path to take. ",1,2,187

2ACB43DD4A24,"Conclusion.For example, a classmate named Generic_Name and I are having problems between ourselves. I do not know whether to apologize or to let the freindship die off. I ask ten people in my class about their opinion on Generic_Name. Nine out of the ten people think that Generic_Name has a very self loathing and snippy personality. They also say that he often does not care about his friends and only does things that please himself.

Because I asked my fellow classmates, I now have a sense of Generic_Name's personality traits. The majority of my classmates did not like Generic_Name very much. Mrs. Generic_Name, my math teacher, often gets mad at Generic_Name and sends him home with misbehavior notes for his parents to read. I now know that Generic_Name is not a very nice person and is prone to getting into trouble. Based on what I have heard from others and what I have learned in class about Generic_Name, I have come to the conclusion that it would not be a wise decision to become friends with Generic_Name again. Becoming friends with Generic_Name would set me up for failure. I would fall under the influence of Generic_Name and most likely get myself into trouble. ",3,2,204

This person could have a number of options to decide from so that they will get more ideas for the advice they could recieve. Asking for advice from one person is not a very good way for getting opinions, because that person will not have as many options as a great deal of people could have. The person getting advice should not decide on one person to get opinion from because they might not get as many ideas as they would like to get. Having more opinions to influence from can make up a huge decision for a person that is seeking more to options. ",3,2,123

2DE95E7D6776,"Conclusion.Listening to different ideas may inspire you to tweak you decision. When I had just moved into a different house, I was presented with an age old teenage dilemma: how to decorate my room? Consulting with my parents, sister, friends, and my wise pet dog, I settled on a blue comforter and yellow walls. However, when sometimes you've strained your brain but no solution has been thought up, the presented advice may end up being the one you pick. In the book

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,

Harry Potter has no idea how to contact Sirius Black. Luckily for him, his friends do. With their help, a plan was hatched with the involvement of invisible gas and breaking into the headmaster's office, all things he wouldn't have thought of himself. My grandmother's saying, ""Our brains are crazy in different ways,"" in this case, isÂ an extremely accurate expression. ",3,2,153
2E4A88C4D580,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion, seeking multiple people's opinions is more beneficial than only seeking one. You can face the situation knowing you did the best you could to prepare for it. Next time you you resort to only asking one person for advice, think twice because it will be helpful to talk to people who have experienced your situation, you will have more ways to overcome an unexpected challenge, and you can let all of your emotions out to everyone.Â Â  ",1,2,80

2F1FD58DEA2F,Conclusion.less stress about the decision. ,0,2,6
2F1FD58DEA2F,"Conclusion.However, when others also understand your situation, it is a lot less of a weight to carry. Talking to more than one person can help relieve the stress a lot more than if it is carried by only one or two people. For instance, I was very stressed about an upcoming competition and I could not focus on studying. I explained my situation to many of my friends and they helped me calm down and gave me advice on how to focus and study. Getting advice from many people helped me relieve my stress and do well at the competition. I felt more calm because of the support from my friends after getting advice. Making sure you are not stressed is very important because it could affect your studies and relationship with friends and family. By asking more than one person for advice, you will most likely be less stressed. ",3,2,151
2FA001A3D229,"Conclusion.In the event that advice is needed, asking two or maybe even three people can be a lotÂ more reassuring. New ideas are brought to the table meaning more options to choose from when the decision needs to be made. As an example, Generic_Name might not know what to do when the school bully tells him to meet him after school on the blacktop to fight. Generic_Name asks his friend what to do and his friend has the same idea as him. Asking two or three people might give new or maybe even better ideas than the one that he thought of. So now Generic_Name is avoiding the fight, and is safe because his other friends told him to tell the principal. ",3,2,123
2FA001A3D229,"Concluding Statement.There are times when you need some advice, and a lotÂ of it. Asking more than one person is better in many different ways.

355534539B7E,"Conclusion.the person could see the problem from different perspectives, ",0,2,10
355534539B7E,"Conclusion.For example, in a 6rd grade class there was a boy who had trouble in history class, there was a history test on the following Friday, the boy was worried so he asked his best friend, Generic_Name what he should do, Generic_Name told him not to stress and that to study and he'll be fine. He trusted his friend's advice but asked his other friend, Generic_Name, just to be sure, his other friend told him that the test was 20 questions mostly surrounding the declaration of independence, after getting this information he studied his notes surrounding the declaration of independence and ended up getting a 98% on his history test, due to knowing what to expect. The boy at first only asked his best friend but after getting advice from another person, he understood what the test was about and what he should do. This method of asking multiple people for advice helped him and if he had not asked his other friend for advice, he would have been unprepared for the test. Besides the reasons to ask multiple people for advice, getting a different perspective and getting additional information,there is still another major reason to ask multiple people for advice, which is on the off chance that the first person(s) they asked were biased, and didnt give them direct information based on facts and not opinions. ",3,2,229
355534539B7E,"Concluding Statement.whether someone has a small problem like which franchise they support or if its a more intricate problem like a miss communication that could destroy a life long friendship, no matter how big or small the problem is asking advice is always something that helps and asking multiple people for advice could help make a better choice when dealing with a problem. Asking multiple peopleÂ helps when someone needs a new perspective, additional information of the topic or if they just arent sure if the person they are getting advice from is biased.

In all asking for advice from multiple people is helpful solution and is highly recommended to many people when dealing with a problem where they can use some advice with a problem they are struggling with. ",1,2,131
3579E5EE4EC8,"Conclusion.This is helpful because certain people may know things which you don't know. The way you view a person is probably different from the way your friend views a person and whether it's positive or negative it's important to listen to that opinion because they could effect your decision.

370732B4F376,Conclusion.I believe looking for multiple opinions from different people when a person asks for advice to make a better decision is important because it could lead the person's mind up to more options ,0,2,34
370732B4F376,"Conclusion.Having different options when making a decision is very important because there are open choices that are good and bad. Every day people ask for advice whether it comes from finding what clothes to wear, to asking for advice if you should get married or not. That benefits a whole lot because sometimes all a person needs is a barrier to select between. Imagine if a person was at the store trying to buy something for their mom on her birthday. The person had to choose between a hand bag or some expensive sunglasses they had found; although, they didn't know what to get her. However they brought one of their siblings to help choose. I think having people to help you make a right decision every once in a while is necessityÂ in life, even though you don't want to get overly used to it. ",3,0,147

39556E3D684B,Conclusion.This results in being able to see how others actually feel. Someone else might see something in a totally different way then you see it. They might show something that is completely obvious that you never saw. Better ideology and reasons might be received as well. Doing so opens up new possibilities for different ideas. Asking others for their opinion certainly gives multiple points of view. ,3,2,67
39556E3D684B,"Conclusion.Whether it is the person your asking or asking about, they will appreciate the thought. Not only will they feel appreciative, but they know that you care. They will feel involved with ones life. They also might ask for your advice one day knowing you asked them. Wanting someones opinion will prove to them that you care about them in many ways.

3BE93D14041D,"Conclusion.Now this reason would probably apply to someone who is seeking advice before a decision. An example of this reason : Generic_Name needs a new bike,so he goes in the bike shop and ask his friends for advice on which bike he should get and they do now. Generic_Name goes to the counter and the cashier gives him some advice so now he can compare and contrast the bikes in his head and decide which one to get. In the example Generic_Name has three point of views on the different bikes so he could easily make a choice. This is like research but from people who have done the research. Also Advice comes from friends and family mostly so you Know it isn't bad advice. ",3,2,127

Life is all about making choices everyday and people have to accept the results that come out of it.

This concept is the purpose of education, the transmission of knowledge. Educating the younger generations is a major aspect of modern society. It is crucial for the progression of the human race. However, like all things, education is constantly adjusting to new discoveries and technologies. Online classrooms are being offered as an alternative to physically attending classroom sessions. ",4,2,78
46B92194BDB8,"Conclusion.Student and teacher interactions in person can develop connections and a sense of trust that will help students better understand the concepts that specific teacher is teaching them. Online classrooms put a physical barrier between teachers and students which prevent any of these interactions. For example, my chemistry class does a flipped classroom, which is a teaching style where students are sent home to watch videos on the concepts of chemistry that we will later apply in class. I could wrap my head around some concepts, but some things just seemed unclear. When practicing writing out chemical reactions on my own, I had many questions that I needed to write out with my teacher in order to clarify. It was not until I came into class that I could sit down with my teacher and write out reactions with her that I fully grasped onto the concept. Similar to myself, it seems like most of my peers are hands on learners, where they understand concepts best when actually applying them and going through a process. This is an effective learning style consisting of developmental progression through the medium of a mentor, which in this case is the teacher. Online sessions lack this physical medium students can work with in order to fully understand concepts they are being taught, leading to ineffective education that will not benefit students.

4790D181C8D5,"Conclusion.At first I was a shy little girl, but very talkative with only the people I knew personally. School taught me social skills at a very young age which allowed me to be comfortable around others, and it opened me up to be inviting to people I don't even know. See, children benefit off of public schools, but at home distance learning can't really benefit children in this area. Distance learning allows you to be by yourself, which isn't very good all the time. Too much time spent alone learning information by yourself can cause you to become a hermit, or even worse, it can cause you depression.

4A292725EE82,"Concluding Statement.seeking advice from multiple people can be extremely useful for a multitude of problems. From fixing a car that can't seem to stay fixed to not knowing who to vote for, multiple people giving advice can help a lot. The President of the United States has the cabinet, which is a group of people dedicated to giving the president advice. So, if there's a big problem that needs to get solved and the advice of one person isn't working, try one more person, and if that doesn't work, one more, if that doesn't work, keep going until it does, because there's a high chance that someone can help with whatever the problem is, even if it isn't your inner circle of friends or colleagues, the advice that you need could be close by and you could never even realize it, it could be at multiple points nearby, and you could never even know that several people is what you're looking for.

But if they consulted many advisers before making that vital decision, the advisers might agree with the president, resulting in the president feeling more confident with their decision and ultimately leading the country better than if they just went with what one person said and didn't ask multiple people for advice first.

I decided to look into the schools themselves rather than which ones my friends were attending. I looked for a school that met my personal standards and one that adults I know can tell me about. A lot of people told me that Generic_School was in my best interest and most closely fit the criteria I was looking for. They told me about the positives and negatives of it and compared it to other schools. It took me a while to make the decision, but I am glad I did.

This is actually extremely helpful and would help you open up your mind and realize more ways to go about your issue. One other thing that may happen is someone may tell you something that is against what others have been telling you. For example if most people tell you to talk to a trusted adult, and then this one person says to only rely on your friends. Then you may realize that not everyone you talk to knows what they are saying. My final example is the chance that if people are talking to you as if what they say are facts, sometimes you may need to double check on that stuff. Receiving more than one opinion works somewhat like a fact checker and helps you realize if someone may be telling you false so called ""facts"". Being provided with multiple opinions not only allows you to open up your mind it will really show you the right advice from the wrong advice. With only one opinion you wouldn't be able to recognize these things as easily. ",3,2,192

This happens because when you are opened up to so many points of view it lets you be basically unrestricted in problem solving ideas. One other thing that goes along with this advantage is that you could lead to an invention. Inventions are just ways to get around a problem in life. When we receive multiple points of view like this is opens up our creativity and problem solving to a wider array of options. One of those options could be something totally new, which would be an invention. Receiving multiple points of view and a wider range of ideas is in my opinion the best part of getting advice from more than one person.

Some people said they were terrible, so terrible in fact they would be comparable to eating dirt; however, many more people said that Sausage Mcgriddles were delicious, they said that biting into a Sausage Mcgriddle was like biting into a world of pancake, syrup, and sausage heaven; they said it was a whole breakfast in one sandwich.

If you just ask one person you only get one opinion, and with one opinion you certainly can't find the majority because it's only one opinion. When you ask multiple people their opinions you can find the majority, if you don't want to go with the majority you can use the opinions to look at the situation from a different perspective, and if you don't want to do that just list all the reasons the people had behind their opinions and then decide, in your opinion, which reasons are good, logical reasons and what course of action do they support.

You can learn from those past experiences, figure out what went wrong and if nothing did go wrong, then see how you could make it better. It really helps when you know the background of most people's experience related to the topic. You can piece together the information, or write a list of the pros and cons of each perpective and combine all the pros. Finally, when you have your idea of all the perspectives you now know which choice you or others could most benefit from. The choice could now help benefit all kinds of people, since you understand the perspective of all people big and small. ",3,2,132

When you change something about a person, there could other people who depend on them to do something but they can't because of the choice you made. It could be a policeman or a firefighter that has his or her schedule changed, then somebody needs help but the policmen or firefighters aren't doing his or her job right now. Lastly, all of this makes you look like a careless human being. All humans judge based on a person's first impression, it wouldn't help if you ruined everyone's lives.

The way I interact with others has changed due to what I have learned from my friends and close mentors. I do not think I would be the same person today if I were to take online schooling. Going to school has shaped the way I view the world and my perspective on topics that may be controversial. Though there are other people in my life that affect my character, the majority of my time spent is based on school.

62FC97D29846,"Conclusion.High school students must wake up quite early in the morning (typically before dawn), prepare for school, and drive through several minutes of traffic to arrive early: just to sit in various classrooms for ninety minutes at a time, completing classwork and receiving additional homework. How much more convenient it would be for some students to wake up whenever their body indicates it is adequately rested, get a healthy meal for breakfast, and work at their own pace in the comfort of their home. Such a relaxed schedule would be beneficial, especially for senior students in high school. Throughout the year, their minds are focused on completing college applications, applying for financial aid, sending in SAT scores and college transcripts. Taking online courses from home would allow those students to attend to their other responsibilities and manage classwork at their own convenience. In addition, some students, unfortunately, get bullied in school by their classmates. Studying at home would allow victims of bullying to be in their safe haven, away from those who oppress them and ridicule them for being different. Often times, high school students worry that colleges would view their decision to take online classes as lazy or careless, however, I have heard that colleges value how challenging the class is, the effort put in, and how well-rounded the student is.

You can even get advice on which classes to take next year or what sports you want to do or how you can convince your parents to let you do the sport that you want to do.

The best way to get better at sports is to seek advice from people who have played it for a long time.

Most sports like basketball or wrestling are just experience dominates.

In basketball if you are guarding someone with a lot of experience then it is going to be a lot harder because they already know the sport like the back of their hand.

It is always the best to seek advice from older players.

Because they have played the sport longer than you have and know how most people play.

He or she would be focused on the gratification of his peers while distracting him from his schoolwork. If this student was taking a distance learning program he would not have to force himself through this unnecessary stress.

73F69FA2E0E3,Conclusion.We as a species are very passionate and thrive off of compassion. Studies have shown that this current generation is statistically the most depressed it has ever been. Connecting studies show that this is due to majority of millennialsÂ feeling lonely due to the inability to communicate properly with others. This is due to the over usageÂ of technology to communicate rather than face to face interaction. Most people when asked when they have talked to others in person answer with either in school or in a place of business. We can't revert the effects technology has had on society but we can surely stop it from getting worse. Implementing distance learning would only cut off a form students from getting an already stagnant amount of social reaction that is needed. Thus leading us to an even more depressed society. ,3,2,141

When someone has had not good experiences with something will probably not recommend you do that same thing where as if someone has had a good time doing something they might recommendÂ it. For example when a friend of mine was preparing to go on vacation to Florida, he was wondering if he should take a plane or drive. Many people he asked said that when they had been on planes they were not pleased with the comfort abilityÂ of them and that he should drive. Others said that in their experiences of being on a plane where quite enjoyable and that driving would be very long and boring.

84EC5D05E3E2,"Conclusion.Waking up for school five days a week, at 5 a. m. is a challenge. Some teenagers, such as myself, are sleep deprived for righteous reasons: working late and completing homework or projects. Others have to do both, once in a while. But learning at home can give students an opportunity to get enough rest to get their work completed. Furthermore, some days at school are not spent learning. Instead, they are spent out of class because of school cancellations due to incliment weather, out-of-school suspensions, in-school-suspensions, or in the administrators office, getting disciplined for a violation of the dress code. Valuable instructional time is lost, whereas online education works around these obstacles. As a matter of fact, none of these factors are of importance when one is attending school from home.

Then, if students had questions, the teacher could answer them in the stream or message the students independently. This method is fantastic, because all of the lectures can be recorded and shown for future reference at other times. If students didn't understand the material, they could just load up the needed information and relearn it and solidify the information into their memory.

8C15FC3C3BCB,Conclusion.it would be easy to cheat ,0,2,7
8C15FC3C3BCB,"Conclusion.Many students would say that they would never do such a thing, that they must honor their integrity, but they're lying. Teenagers are impulsive, and if there is an easy road out, we are going to take it, simple as that. For example, if a teacher gives an assignment and they say the answer key is on schoology to check our work, we're going to maybe attempt it. When we don't succeed, guess where we're going: Schoology. I'm saying that I don't trust teenagers to be able to honestly do every single assignment on their own especially if there are no eyes watching. Another example of this would be in a scenario of this said online school. Imagine that there's a big test due on the 18th in math that you haven't studied for. Today is the 17th. Everyone else has done the test and taken pictures of it in case their computers shut down, while others had malicious intent. You haven't studied at all. Your failure is imminent as you already have a C in the class and you need a C to graduate. Your heart is thumping, you don't want to seem a failure to your parents. So what do you do? Ask the teacher for an extension? No, he's too strict and he's going to say no. So you think your only option is to cheat. So you text a student who took picures for the wrong reason. You get the answers you so desperately wanted. But at what cost? You take the test and get a 70. You nearly failed, but you didn't. You find out a few days later that several students have asked for an extension and received one. That is the mindset a lot of students go through when they cheat on a test or assignment. ",3,2,304
8C15FC3C3BCB,"Conclusion.On the contrary, they are extremely wrong because you wouldn't be able to see them everyday as you normally do during the school day. ",6,0,25
8C15FC3C3BCB,"Concluding Statement.Some people say that taking school online or with video cameras is beneficial. However, they are incorrect because it would be easy to cheat and students would face isolation from their friends. Cheating would be readily available as you don't have the teachers eyes on you which makes it easier to cheat, no matter how honest a teenager says they are because we are impulsive beings who rarely think logically. Isolation would be a terrible added factor of online school as friends keep most of us going during the school day. ",1,2,93
8D2C20BDCDE0,"Conclusion.Although a student should rest and recover when they're sick, ",2,0,11
8D2C20BDCDE0,"Conclusion.Another example where distance learning is beneficial for students is when they have a family situation. A student might be out of school for a couple days due to a family situation and could fall behind on work. Being able to go to school online or video conference would help that student stay on track with work and not have to spend a week trying to catch up on missed work when they return to school. For example, I had a family member suddenly pass away a while ago, and I had to attend their funeral. As a result, I had to miss a couple of days of school and fell behind on a lot of work. Because it was so sudden, I couldn't plan ahead with my teachers and eventually was stressed out when I came back to school due to the amount of work I had. If online learning had been an option for me, I would've been able to stay on track in school and not have to deal with the stresses of catching up on missed work. ",3,2,182

This has happened to me before and resulted in me losing lots of money. If you ask one person then another person ones advise might be better than the other one. So what if you didnt ask both? One time a friend told me to jump off the roof, but my other friend said us the ladder and I used the ladder and made it down safe. You could also ask three people and one isnt good at giving advise one is okay and the other is good dont you wanna ask all three so you can get good advise? This is usually like my friends vs. my parents. This is my second reason why I think you should ask multiple people. ",3,0,151

You should ask multiple people because everyone dosent know whats best for you. My parents are the only people who know whats best for me.

Also your friends and peers dont always have your best interest in mind, sometimes they could give you bad advice to be funny. This happens to me all the time. This is my third reason why seeking more than one opinion can help you make a better choice. ",3,2,115
8F85E4509835,"Concluding Statement.When asking for advice seeking more than one opinion can help you make a better choice. Reasons why are you would want to ask someone who has been through it before, one person might not be good at giving advise as someone else would, and one person might not have your best interestÂ in mind like some others. This is why I feel like you should seek for more than one opinion when asking for advise. I hope you will seek for more than one opinion next time you ask for advise.

93DC556B7C04,"Conclusion.Many famous people who became famous for their work of whatever expertise they acquired usually didn't ask for just one specific person's idea. They saw many people's criticism to something that they made, and they improved their idea gradually, such as

The Simpsons.

When they first made the main characters, it seemed to be poorly drawn and the voices were weird, but as the episodes went on and on, the characters and voices had smoothed out and improved to what they are today. Having one person to ask for your opinion can sometimes be just the right thing to make your project approved by one person other than you, but sometimes asking other people can give you many more perspectives to look at, giving you an upgraded idea for the one you just had ",4,2,135
93DC556B7C04,"Conclusion.The more compliments you receive, the more people who say they like the idea. Many famous writers used other people's thoughts to see whether or not their book is good, and they ask for their opinion. An example from me is my favorite series of books:

Gone Series.

On the front cover of the book, it has one quote from an author, and on the back there were many other quotes from other companies. Adding to the quotes, on the top of the book said

#1 New York best Selling Book , basically saying to new readers that this series is good and popular. That is usually why on the front cover or back cover of a book contains a quote from different people or companies showing their good opinion about this book, so the readers can see that since this person liked the book, then it must be a good book to read. Having an award on your book also brings in popularity because winning something like the Pulitzer prize can bring a ton of attention to your book. It can give you more to believe in that your project will be good because you have many people who say your project is good. Not just the people who say that it's just ""good"", but also the people who point out the things that they especially liked within your idea, such as, ""I liked how you included this part to make that huge problem go away."" These kinds of compliments makes you feel even better inside, and it tells you that you can take your mind off that one part of the idea and imagine more possible problems. ",3,2,280
952CB87D4897,"Conclusion.If you live by the motto ""Put others before yourself"" it is critical to understand that the decision you make could negatively affect others, as well as yourself. An example of this is smoking marijuana. By doing this, you could be causing others to be doing it as well, just because you are doing it. You could be at a legal age, but marijuana is still bad for you as well as others. Asking your friends if they are okay with it and if it is a good decision, can cause you to realize that in the long run, it is a bad and not a thought-out decision. Like said before, other people's lives are also important and seeking help before a decision, to make sure that it is good and well-thought out, can make a true impact in others. ",3,2,141
952CB87D4897,"Conclusion.Also, as modern day society is getting bigger and bigger, and people are becoming more reliant on safety, it is extremely important to ensure and provide safety for each individual, and asking for other's advice can ensure you that your decision is safe and responsible.

9DCA96730E4B,"Conclusion.Having more than one solution gives you no limitations. You have a choice and options on how you would like to react to the problem or decision you are trying to make. Also by seeing other perspectives, you can make good choices with the options you have and know how to pick the best choice. For example, you own a company and you get an offer with a lot of money to cut down the forest and build a mall in its place. You don't know what your answer is going to be and you just don't know how to make that decision. You go to ask your friends and family about what they think you should do. They give you multiple answers to the decision and multiple points of view. Your mom says yes, take the deal, there are so many trees in the world, you cutting down a 100 isn't going to affect anything. Your friend says no, don't take the deal, there are animals and creatures that depend on those trees for survival. Your cousin says take the deal, but change the coniditons, build the mall somewhere else. You hadn't even thought about the animals that depend on those trees! Now by having all these new perspectives and all these new choices, you are able to make the best decision for the enviroment and for yourself. ",3,2,230
9DCA96730E4B,"Concluding Statement.Making a decision is extremely difficult and stressful, but asking others for input and advice on the issue can help you make the right choice because it widens your mindset, you end up having more than one solution and more than one perspective on the topic, and you learn from others past and gain information and knowledge from it. You don't want to be in the position where you ask only one person for their advice and listen to them, only to realize they really didn't know what they were saying. The one guranteed way to prevent that from happening is by getting multiple peoples opinions. Now, next time you are faced with a huge choice to make, I hope you ask more than one person about what they think you should do.Â  ",1,2,135

As time went on some situations became too heavy to handle, the stress grew on top of her. At school she only showed perkiness, meanwhile, she was in a darker place. No one was aware of this until a few weeks later when she spoke to her friends, then counselors, next teachers and eventually her parents to get the help she wanted. She was afraid of what the world would think of her if she wasn't perfect. These people all helped her find ways for comfort and how to get the treatment needed without doing something harmful to herself or others.

BA881F8A8909,"Conclusion.Stress and anxiety among students is extremely high.

Many kids have test anxiety and are not able to perform well in testing environments.

Testing anxiety can be caused by numerous factors but one factor that stands out the most is feeling comfortable in an environment.

If the student does not feel comfortable in their classroom while taking a test, they will not produce a good grade.

If the student is placed in a well suited environment, like their home, they are guaranteedÂ to receive a better grade than if they were placed in a classroom.

Secondly, if students are able take their time and not rush through school work, stress levels will reduce and the amount of passing students will increase.

Students often feel rushed to finish in a short amount of time in order to please their teachers.

Although many teachers preach to their students to take their time, teachers unknowingly put a time restriction on student.

Online courses allow kids to start and finish assignment when they feel comfortable doing so.

Online classes lowers the chance of stress among students by eliminating classroom anxiety. 
",3,2,187
BA881F8A8909,"Conclusion.In order to graduate at many public and private schools, students must meet graduation requirements.

There are multiple classes a student must take to graduate that are electives.

These classes take up space in kid's schedules restricting the amount of core classes a student can take.

If schools allow these kids to take these classes in their free time, students will be able to complete these courses and move onto classes they will use in the future.

For example, all school require students to partake in a health class throughout their high schoolÂ careers.

If students are capable of taking this class in the summer rather than in the school year, a new gap in their schedule opens for another class.

Also, online schools prevent advance students from burning out.

Many children who were placed in advanced learning at a young age experience a burn out.

This occurs when the student does not have to work as hard in their education as others.

This produces a poor work ethic, which is essential in the real world.

By allowing these students to take an extra course online, they will be challenged forcing them to improve their work ethic and time management.

Online school gives students a chance to get ahead in their education 
",3,2,213
BA881F8A8909,"Concluding Statement.In conclusion, students should be given the opportunity to participate in online school because they will have the ability to work at a their own speed, reduce their stress levels, and participate in more classes.

If students are unable to take online courses, they are more likely to get off track in their learning.

By giving students this education outlet, students will be more likely to graduate and be ready to dive into their adult lives. ",1,2,78

C2A6C69714EC,"Conclusion.Well not everyone you ask could have the right information, some could be telling false or just bad information. So getting other opinions could come in big for you if the first opinion was not very good. For example if you are trying to get a opinion on what you should buy a family member for a gift and you only get one opinion and they say that the person likes something but they really don't then that could be pretty bad for you. I don't think you would be to pleased either if that happened so just get a second opinion so everyone can be happy. Also sometimes the opinion could just be really bad and not help you at all. So do your self a favor and get multiple opinions.

Sometimes you might have the smarter idea, sometimes they will have the smarter idea. I know if I had to make a big, life-changing decision that I would ask all of my closest friends. I can recall one time when I was making a personal decision about a year ago, and I did not know what to do. I asked my closest friends what I should do, and almost all of them responded just about how I expected them to. Most of them said they wanted to see me happy, so they encouraged me to choose the decision that would make me the happiest. Others gave me facts, pros and cons, and why they would be disappointed if I made one decision over the other. They then told me that they believed in me, and I would eventually make the right decision. Having those multiple points of view on what they thought really helped me decide on what I should do.

After listening to all of their thoughts, you find some are much more brilliant than yours. You then go back and completely rethink your decisions, just because of those few opinions. After extensive thought, you decide that your original idea was bogus. When you first make a decision, even if you had thought about for a long time, the stress of making a decision quick can sometimes fog your thinking. That is why having other people's opinions can help you make the right decision, even if it is the second time trying to choose what is best for you. ",3,2,158

D1748C4CD7B4,"Conclusion.All things considered, though, the potential for the waste of students' time in no way warrants a dismissal of distance learning. Especially when considering all of the students that would otherwise not be able to learn, the meager amount of work to set up technology restrictions for those schools who desire it is most definitely worth it in the long run. Furthermore, simply because some students may abuse the power of distance learning does not mean that it should not be offered to those who truly need it. ",3,2,89
D1748C4CD7B4,"Concluding Statement.Distance learning should be made available to all applicable students because it allows for long-term home boundÂ students to attend classes, short-term absent students to make up their school work faster, and increases the student-technology relationship. Distance learning programs would not only help the students in keeping up with their studies, but also teachers in supplying their students with adequate learning resources for all situations. It has become even more prevalent now; as the COVID-19 virus spreads internationally, more and more schools and universities are transitioning to virtual learning for the safety of students, teachers, and staff. Truly, distance learning ensures the safety of those involved without sacrificing any of the benefits of a physical classroom.

Many time studying at home give students many issues; there can be many people at home and too much noise that the student would not be able to concentrated and will get distracted. It can also happen that watching a video and that there's no one there to explain it; can make the students tire and he/she can fall sleep. Also, students will not take it seriously because there's not a teacher telling them and explaining them what to do. They would not receive as much education, information, and attention as they need. My position on this issue is to maintain the students attending to school. The students will learn more if they receive classes in school. Attend classes in a classroom with a teacher will provide students more support and it would help them in many ways to be successful in the future.Â    Â Â  ",1,0,203
D31481D3B465,"Conclusion.. If people were to ask and receive only one response, the outcome becomes very limited and may not connect with a large audience. In order for it to apply to the audience, everyone would have to have the exact same thought process and opinions as the person the author asked; which is very unlikely. If someone wishes to connect with a variety of people, in this case a larger audience, they must have an understanding of many perspective and points of view. This way the outcome will apply to more people with different thoughts and opinions. ",3,2,97

It's always important to ask for assistance and feedback when you need it. Because receiving that constructive criticism and working with it reassures the outcome is successful and applies to a larger audience.

Two minds sometimes create bias, and at times bias is good. One would benefit from hearing the other side of the argument which may ultimately end one's single-sided thinking. Also having the classroom aspect where you have multiple people who look at the same thing in different ways is important as well. Maybe the way student A looks at something is more compliant to your way of thinking rather than student B. Classmates help each otherÂ if the teacher can not, there are many instances in my learning here at Generic_School where I come to the terms of understanding a subject, but once one of my classmates broke it down for me in their way of thinking and seeing, a new light shown over the way I looked at things.

D7B12358DBA3,"Conclusion.Because classes are taken online, the teacher or instructor utilizes different technological tools and resources for lesson plan and activities. It broadens the possibilities of how information can be delivered to students and the different class work students can participate in. Online classes can also seem a more appealing option to in person classes, as lessons and assignments tend to be more direct and straight forward. Often times, school teachers give ""fluff"" assignments that don't necessarily have a purpose or that don't offer much learning potential. These assignments are given to pass time and give students an activity to do whether in class or for homework. I have endured my share of ""fluff"" assignments throughout high school. During my sophomore year, I despised English class because I didn't seem to gain anything out of it. My teacher would assign miscellaneous assignments such as a food poem or a repetitive packet of work. Online classes tend to include less of these ""fluff"" assignments because they differ from traditional in person classes where students meet personally with teachers. There is less of a worry to keep students occupied with different assignments each class. With the Generic_School Online Campus, students are given assignments to complete each week with the due date at the end of that week. Teachers tend to give less unnecessary assignments because the class can be more spread out throughout the course. ",3,2,233

Suppose the distractions are not an issue. A student sits down at his computer, switches it on, and is greeted by a neon light and artificial sounds. After the lecture, the student reaches out, switches the screen off, and takes a nap. This seems completely fine, but the student is missing a very crucial step; actual human interaction.

While filtering our own bias with this new information, we can formulate possible solutions for ourselves. This is an intriguing way that we can all solve our problems because we can use the experiences of others to better our own. Using the lessons learned by others to prevent yourself from carrying the same misfortunes is a key way to avoid conflict.

E9179F8981D6,"Conclusion.Several students need to be in a classroom to fully understand a topic, and in most cases, learning in a classroom, outside of one's home, can be highly beneficial for certain subjects. Physics, for example, includes many experiments in its curriculum, coverin topics like sound waves. A student may have difficulty understanding sound waves through a virtual laboratory experiment, a factor that distance learning does consider because such programs choose to use one resource for all students, despite there being different types of learners, such as audio, visual, and kinesthetic. In public and private schools, however, teachers offer a variety of resources, including textbooks for visual learners, educational videos for audio learners, and phsyical, not virtual, laboratory experiments for kinesthetic learners. This, in turn, helps all students better comprehend the curriculum. ",3,2,132

E974D272C14E,"Conclusion.With online school there would be few, if not any, interaction between peers or with adults. Teenagers today can barley talk to an adult without looking at their feet and avoiding eye-contact, due to the lessening of interaction in the classrooms. Online learning would only increase the problem. Most jobs across the country and throughout the rest of the world all have a form of interaction whether it is presenting a presentation, discussion inÂ meetings, business calls, marketing, and much more.

E974D272C14E,"Conclusion.Most teenagers do not have the discipline, or attention span to take time out of their day, everyday, to sit down at home for hours on end and learn online. Most teenagers need discipline in the classroom. When in school, if students get off track their is a teacher there to help them focus and be productive. When sitting in a desk at school, teenagers are much more productive then if they were to lay in bed at home watching videos. If one were to take online classes at home they would no longer face the discipline teachers show them everyday in school when saying, ""put your phone away!"" or ""stop talking!"" or ""wake up!"".

EDACE717C302,"Conclusion.Online learning accommodates students with disabilities as well as students with injuries that may prevent them from easily leaving their homes. It is unfair that our education system would require that they come to school when they can learn the same, or potentially more information from home. Recently, it has become clear that online learning is feasible for an entire school. Take for example, schools in Italy or South Korea. These countries have temporarily closed their schools until April in order to better combat the novel corona virus, COVID-19. That said, the schools are still holding lessons online where attendance is taken and students are given the same education by the same teachers, only through a computer screen. If it is feasible for other nations to accommodate for their students during a health epidemic then surely we can also implement a similar program for our students during times of peace. Furthermore, we can not, both morally and legally, allow for our disabled students to receive a sub parÂ education than their peers. That is a disservice not only to them but the moral foundation and integrity of the community as a whole. Similarly, students with mental illnesses like depression or anxiety are more likely to be productive and learn in an online setting than they are in the classroom ",3,2,220
EDACE717C302,"Conclusion.If online learning or video conferencing was made available to home schooledÂ students and be used as a supplement to a child's learning, then it will benefit the student's education. ",0,2,31
EDACE717C302,Conclusion.Another benefit of online classes is that they are essential for students who wish to take advantage of the fact that all of the courses at public schools are free. ,0,2,31
EDACE717C302,"Concluding Statement.
Although formal classroom education has been -and still remains- the standard of public education, as our society moves more and more towards complete digitization of daily life, our system of education should also keep pace and be made to offer distance learning as an option for all students for better students' accommodation, education, and choice in their education. Since this education will last our students a lifetime, we should never falter in giving them the quality education that they are entitled to in the Constitution of this great nation. ",1,2,91
EDDFFD34DBD4,Conclusion.From experience it's a lotÂ better to get more advice than a little amount. I needed some advice about a game to buy so i went to one of my closest friends he told me to get a game that he had and it would be super fun if we both played it together. but i was pretty hesitant of just buying the game because i didn't think i would play it very much because it didn't seem that interesting to me so what i did was went to a couple more of my other friends and they all suggested a different game than what my best friend suggested but they all suggested the same game everyone else did though and since they all had the game i went with the game they suggested and now i play it almost everyday with them. ,3,0,144
EDDFFD34DBD4,Conclusion.opinions. ,0,1,2
EDDFFD34DBD4,Conclusion.The source's could have different opinions if you talk a lot different sources you might hear something you didn't even think about and that could change the solution to your problem for the better or for the worse. Like with the video game situation listened to my other friend's game suggestions i would had wasted my money on something i wasn't going to play i did listen to my other friends opinions i bought something i want to play. so you see that even strange suggestions can help make a decision on if you want to buy or sell or maybe even keep something. but like i said different suggestions can have a great impact on what your decision may be because without my best friend'sÂ suggestion i wouldn't have gone an talked to my other friend's about what i should buy. ,3,0,143

F54BD89B665A,"Conclusion.receiving help from a teacher or an instructor would be more limited and restricted if one were to take an online course. 
",0,2,23
F54BD89B665A,"Conclusion.Take for example, completing an online course. When students are at home taking the online course, they are placed in a more comfortable environment that lacks a working ambiance. Consequently, there is a greater chance that the student could focus their attention away from the work because of distractions that may include: television, chores, video games, and others. They may also more easily have the tendency to slack off and fall behind. While completing work at a school, students are surrounded by materials that place them in the mindset of their education, and provided help and support that encourages learning and success, rather than the at home comforts. Fortunately, at school there are a limited number of things that will focus ones attention away from what is needed to be completed, and done to the fullest potential with effort. In a working environment the encouragement to learn not only comes from the instructors, but also the other students that also attend the school. ",3,2,164
F54BD89B665A,"Conclusion.Through these shared concepts, students can learn and comprehend more information off of one another, and make connections through certain ideas that are shared in class. This is demonstrated not only through group assignments, but through the participation of students during a class lesson. When a student is called on to share aloud, they are sharing an idea that may benefit someone else's learning experience, and help with their improvement and understanding of the curriculum in the class. School group projects allow students to share their ideas towards one another and further their comprehension of the relevant information. The students may develop a new way to perceive the topic, which, beneficially, is crucial for their success in the course and in the future. Ideas are not only defined through other students, but are defined through the professionalism the teachers carry in the course. ",3,2,144
F54BD89B665A,"Conclusion.Although some may make claim that taking a course at home provides for more personal time to complete other necessary tasks, and can learn the same information as those who are attending an actual school, ",2,2,36
F54BD89B665A,"Concluding Statement.Schools are not only beneficial but are crucial success not only in the courses they are taking, but in future roles, whether that be, for example, in a career, or becoming financially stable. Secondary options to attending a school, like courses at home, are not the same and do not hold the same roles or positions as a school do in the sense of a person's success.Â  ",1,2,69

F93D06BC99D8,"Conclusion.Once, there was a woman named Generic_Name who was tasked with budgeting her family's money and spending it in the best way. She needed to decide whether to stay home during Spring break and spend a little more on food and eating out more often, or she could go on a vacation and use less money on dining out. There is no bad decision here, she thinks, but the vacation that her family wants is very expensive so budgeting would be harder. She asks her friend, Generic_Name, who just took a family vacation, about whether she should take out money to spend on this lavish vacation. She decides, based on Generic_Name's opinion and based on her own, that she should allot funds to this vacation that the family wants over Spring break, and eat out less often. She found later that she made the poorer of the two decisions. Did you know that many people around the world receive advice every day, and learn that the advice they received was incorrect. Those people deeply regret their decision that they made earlier that was incorrect ",4,2,185
F93D06BC99D8,"Conclusion.When you are seeking advice you will have a higher chance of finding the correct decision because getting multiple options can make finding the general consensus easier, it can help you in finding poor decisions, and it gives you past decisions to see what happened and what might happen to you ",0,2,52
F93D06BC99D8,"Conclusion.For many decisions, you don't need advice of your peers, but some do, and it is best for those that you get more than one opinion. Studies have shown, that the more sources you have, the more likely you are to make a correct decision, and likewise, the less sources you have, the weaker your decision will be. When you have more people's opinions, you have a higher chance of finding the general consensus and making the correct decision. By mathematics and by logic, you should be able to find correct advice if you have more opinions and beliefs. ",3,2,100

FD05FDCEA11B,"Conclusion.My footsteps seemed impossibly loud as I walked into the classroom, and it felt as if everyone was watching me. I glanced around, taking in the unfamiliar eyes staring me down.

I'm never going to fit in here.

One of the eyes turned away from me and began to speak. She formed strange sounds with her mouth in a language that wasn't familiar to me. I turned around and ran out of the room, feeling so alone, so deserted. Salty tears stained my cheeks.

A week ago, I had taken a 14 hour long flight from

Generic_City to Generic_City. It was my first time being somewhere else other than my home country, and I felt so intimidated by the new environment. Strange shapes, strange sounds, and strange people with impossibly bright hair and piercing eyes surrounded me. It was all beautiful to me - but at the same time, the most horrifying thing I'd ever seen. I felt trapped in a haze. This haze was brimming with thoughts of never fitting in, never adapting to these alien surroundings, and mostly - the crushing feeling of homesickness.

This haze pushed me down into a deep cavern, and I was encapsulated by darkness. Even though my parents tried to find me in this cavern, every search effort was in vain, until something miraculous happened. An angel, perhaps, entered the deep labyrinth and ushered me out. Her name was Ms. Generic_Name. She gave me a new perspective, a new bias. Ms. Generic_Name told me to view this unfamiliar atmosphere as something special, a new opportunity - not a hostile monster trying to swallow me whole. She told me to be glad of the change in my life. This was the first time I had ever listened to somebody's opinion and savored it in my heart. I didn't know the importance of listening to the viewpoints of others at the time. I thought

I always knew what was best; after all, nobody knew me better than myself. I took her words and used them as fuel for learning English and making friends. I thought her words were all I needed, but somehow, I was still in despair. I still struggled. So - I decided to let someone else tell me what they thought was best.

After school, I talked with my parents. I told them what I felt, that I was always alone. That I felt so, so homesick. They told me it was good to feel that way. Moving overseas was a tough thing to endure, and they said it was healthy to let myself feel down sometimes. They told me I didn't always need to pretend I was happy when I was not. These two opinions from Ms. Generic_Name and my parents shaped me as a person - I learned to let people in, and know that seeking multiple opinions is a wise thing to do.Â Because of this, I learned to speak English and surround myself with a group of compassionate, kind friends who guided me through my darkest times. I learned to let in my parents and take notice that they always wanted what was best for me. I learned that I didn't always know what was best, and that was okay. ",4,2,543
FD05FDCEA11B,"Conclusion.Everyone has gone through unique things. After all, our lives are not the same. What people have experienced shape them as a person, and since we're all different, some people may offer advice that's helpful to you while others may not. You'll never know if you've sought out the best advice if you only listen to one person. ",3,2,59

Home schooling, or distance learning, is a route that many young people choose to do as their education. Many people wonder however, how beneficial is it really for students to sit in their living room instead of the classroom?

Schools and classrooms however, either have don't have those distractions or put limits on them to keep students working and not playing games or texting. If some people can't even complete their homework because of these distractions at home, then how will they complete their daily home schooling assignments on top of that? Student work completion would drop and their futures will be impacted dramatically. Many people, especially teenagers, need guidance and restrictions in order to get work done. Even though some students have already created that habit for themselves of getting work done, others have not and giving them an option of distance learning will be devastating for them. ",3,2,133

FEF42864AE28,"Conclusion.A significant problem in schools today, is students getting behind the pace of the class and having to rush in order to catch up. This leads to them not fully grasping the full understanding of what's being taught. Students will also tend to produce sloppier work when rushing and getting a worse grade than they could have. Home school however, does not have this problem as students can go at their own pace whether its fast or slow. This helps students get the grades they deserve instead of rushing and having them not produce their best effort. Having home schooled students work at their own pace also creates beneficial work habits due to them actually doing the full amount of work. If students are not completing the required amount of work or more, than they may start to think that it's appropriateÂ to only give half of their best effort instead of putting the full amount of work in for an assignment.
